<h2><a name="FOREWORD" id="FOREWORD">FOREWORD</a></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the winter of 1905-6 Professor Flinders Petrie undertook
the examination of the Egyptian remains in Sinai. After
working at Wadi Maghara he removed into the Wadi
Umm Agraf to copy the inscriptions and excavate the temple
ruins at Serabit. His work is described in “Researches in
Sinai, 1906,” and the inscriptions are in course of publication
by the Egypt Exploration Fund. Among the workers at
Serabit was myself. I had long been interested in the hermit
life of the peninsula and in the growing belief that the Gebel
Musa was not the Mountain of the Law. The excavations at
Serabit and the non-Egyptian character of the ancient hill
sanctuary supplied new material for reflection. In the hours
spent in sorting fragments of temple offerings and copying
temple inscriptions it occurred to me that we might be on
the site which meant so much in the history of religion.
Studies made after our return suggested further points of
interest. The outcome is this little history which will, I
trust, appeal to those who take an interest in the reconstruction
of the past and in the successive stages of religious
development.</p>

<p class="pc4 elarge">A HISTORY OF SINAI</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER I</h2>

<p class="pch">INTRODUCTORY<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor"><span class="small">[1]</span></a></p>


<p class="drop-cap06">SINAI is the peninsula, triangular in form, which projects
into the Red Sea between Egypt and Arabia. The
name used to be applied to the mountainous region of the
south, now it is made to comprise the land as far north as the
Mediterranean.</p>

<p>Sinai is famous for the part which it has played in the
religious history of mankind. It was at one time a centre of
moon-cult, before it became the seat of the promulgation of the
Law to the Jews at the time of Moses. In Christian times it
was one of the chief homes of the hermits, and the possession
of the relics of St. Katherine in the great convent of the
south, caused Sinai to be included in the Long Pilgrimage
throughout the Middle Ages.</p>

<p>A history of Sinai deals with the people who visited the
peninsula at different times, rather than with its permanent
inhabitants, who, in the course of centuries, seem to have
undergone little change. They still live the life of the huntsman
and the herdsman as in the days of Ishmael, sleeping in
the open, and adding to their meagre resources by carrying
dates and charcoal to the nearest centres of intercourse, in
return for which they receive corn.</p>

<p>The country geographically belongs to Egypt, ethnologically
to Arabia. It falls into three regions.</p>

<p>In the north, following the coast line of the Mediterranean,
lies a zone of drift sand, narrowest near Rafa on the borders
of Palestine, widening as it is prolonged in a westerly direction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
towards Egypt, where it is conterminous with the present
Suez Canal. This desert was known in Biblical days as Shur
(the wall) of Egypt. “And Saul smote the Amalekites
from Havilah (north Arabia), until thou comest to Shur
that is over against Egypt” (1 Sam. xv. 7). The military
highway from Egypt to Syria from ancient times followed the
coast line of the Mediterranean, the settlements along which
were modified on one side by the encroachment of the sea,
on the other by the invasion of sand.</p>

<p>Adjoining this zone of drift sand, the land extends south
with increased elevation to the centre of the peninsula, where
it reaches a height of about 4000 ft., and abruptly breaks off
in a series of lofty and inaccessible cliffs, the upper white
limestone of which contrasts brilliantly in some places with
the lower red sandstone. This region is, for the most part,
waterless and bare. It is known in modern parlance as
the Badiet Tîh (the plain of wandering). Its notable
heights include the Gebel el Ejneh and the Gebel Emreikah.
This plain is drained in the direction of the Mediterranean
by the great Wadi el Arish and its numerous feeders, which,
like most rivers of Sinai, are mountain torrents, dry during the
greater part of the year, and on occasion like the <i>fiumare</i> of
Italy, flowing in a spate. The Wadi el Arish is the River of
Egypt of the Bible (Gen. xv. 18; Num. xxxiv. 5), the <i>Nahal
Muzur</i> of the annals of King Esarhaddon.</p>

<p>The Badiet Tîh is crossed from east to west by the road
from Akaba to Suez, along which the Holy Carpet, which is
made at Cairo, was annually conveyed to Mecca. Halfway
between Suez and Akaba, at Kalaat el Nakhl, the road is
crossed by one coming from Gaza, which is prolonged south
in several directions down precipitous passes. Kalaat en Nakhl
is an important watering place, and was for a time a military
station. It was known in the Middle Ages as a <i>puteus Soldani</i>
(well of the Sultan).</p>

<p>The roads coming from Nakhl lead down the escarpment
of Tîh to a belt of sand and gravel, varying in width, which,
with the arid stretches adjoining it, covers an area of some
thirty square miles. This is the Gebbeter Ramleh (belt of
sand). Its western parts including the Wadi Jarf is the
wilderness of Sin of the Bible (Exod. xvi. 1).</p>

<p>South of this great belt of sand, red sandstone reappears<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
in shelving masses leading up to the great mountainous district
which forms Sinai proper, the third region of the peninsula.
These mountains are traversed by many river-beds or wadies.
Some of them, according to the ways of the country, do not bear
the same name throughout their course, but the main stream
frequently takes another name when it is joined by a tributary.
Thus the Wadi Nasb after its junction with the Wadi Beda
becomes the Wadi Baba, and so forth.</p>

<p>This sandstone district is cut into by deep gorges and
canyons, that have sheer falls of several hundred feet in places.
It comprises the mountains which yielded turquoise and copper,
products that brought the neighbouring people into Sinai.
Beads of turquoise were found in the pre-dynastic tombs of
Egypt which probably came from Sinai, while there was an
increasing demand for copper in the surrounding countries
from the close of the Neolithic Age. If the name Milukhkha
of the Babylonian records refers to Sinai, these people also
came there several thousand years before our era.</p>

<p>Turquoise appears in a ferruginous layer in the sandstone
at the height of about 2650 ft. at Serabit, and at the height of
about 1170 ft. at Maghara above sea-level. The copper ore
occurs in the Wadi Nasb, and in the Wadi Khalig, somewhat
extensively in the latter, together with iron and manganese.
Enormous slag heaps lie at the head of the Wadi Nasb and
near the outlet of the Wadi Baba, which bear evidence to
former smelting activity. Again, in the Wadi Sened, a dyke rich
in copper traverses syenite for a distance of nearly two miles.</p>

<p>The district which was worked by the ancient Egyptians
was comprised between the valley system of the Wadi Baba
on the north, and that of the Wadi Sidreh on the south, both
of which have their outlet in the direction of the coastal plain
of El Markha. It was from this side that the ancient Egyptians
approached Sinai. The chief height of the district is the
Tartir ed Dhami (black cap), so called from the dark basalt
that forms its summit, which rises to a height of 3531 ft.
There is also the double-peaked Umm Riglên (mother of
two feet) which rises to the south of the Wadi Umm Agraf
and dominates the height of Serabit.</p>

<p>To the south of the ancient mining district the sandstone
is connected in a manner highly interesting to the geologist
with the plutonic rock which gives its imposing character to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
the mountains of the south. Here lies the Wadi Feiran,
one of the best watered and fruitful valleys of the peninsula,
to the south of which Mount Serbal rises abruptly from a
comparatively low elevation to the height of 6734 ft. This
mountain has been described as one great lump of diorite, and
its majestic appearance led some recent travellers, including
Lepsius<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> and Bartlett,<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> to identify it as the Mountain of the
Law. Further south lies the great group of mountains which
include the Gebel Musa, 7359 ft. high, and the Gebel Katrîn
with its three peaks, the highest of which rises to 8527 ft.
The Gebel Musa from early Christian times was generally
looked upon as the Mountain of the Law. At its foot lies the
great convent of Sinai, at one time known as the Bush, which
has carried on to the present day the traditions of the early
Christian hermits, who settled in the peninsula. The Gebel
Katrîn lying further south, was looked upon during the later
Middle Ages, as the height on which the angels deposited the
body of St. Katherine. Another imposing height of the group
is the Ras Safsaf, 6540 ft. high, which has been put forward
in recent times as a possible Mountain of the Law.</p>

<p>These mountains of the south contain many natural
springs and fruitful valleys, which were formerly the home
of Christian ascetics. They are divided from the Gulf of Suez
on the west by the desert of El Kaa, which drains a large
amphitheatre of hills, and becomes a coastal plain that extends
as far as Ras Mohammad, the southernmost point of the
peninsula. The desert of El Kaa has a harder subsoil which
is so tilled that the accumulated moisture is thrown up at
the coast near Tur, the chief harbour of the peninsula, and
possibly an ancient Phœnician colony. Near it lay Raithou,
a place of many oases and large date-palm plantations which
were carefully tended by the monks during the Middle Ages.</p>

<p>The south-eastern parts of the peninsula are rarely visited
by Europeans. There are some high mountains, including
the Gebel Thebt (7883 ft.), the Gebel Umm Shomer (8449 ft.),
and the Gebel Umm Iswed (8236 ft.), in districts that were
recently explored by Dr. Hume.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> The eastern coast-line<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
of the peninsula is relatively inaccessible. There are some
creek ports at Sherm, some ten miles north of Ras Mohammad,
and some palm trees with a good supply of water at Nakhb.
From here it is less than eight miles across the sea to Ras
Fartak, the nearest point of Arabia. Further north, opposite
the coastland of what is now reckoned the land of Midian,
lies Dahab and, beyond it, Ain en Nuêbeh, where the road
that leads from the convent to Akaba at the head of the Gulf
of Akaba, reaches the coast. From Akaba the mountains
are prolonged in the direction of Palestine on both sides of the
Wadi el Arabah, the great depression that extends northwards
to the Dead Sea. This is “the land of Seir, the country
of Edom” of the Bible (Gen. xxxii. 3). Edom signifies
red in Hebrew, and the land may have been so called owing
to the red sandstone of the district.</p>

<p>Sinai, generally speaking, is a country of stern desolation.
Its mountains are bare, its plains are swept by the wind, its
river beds are to all appearance waterless. But clusters of
bushes that follow the valley floors or rise from the plains,
show that moisture percolates the soil beneath the surface,
and is procurable by digging down to the harder subsoil,
(<i>i.e.</i> “striking the rock”) as was done at the time of the passage
of the Israelites. Such digging is done by the Bedawyn at
the present day, the holes for water being called <i>hufrah</i> in
Arabic. In some places, however, the water along the valleys
is thrown up and forms natural oases as in the Wadi Gharandel,
the Wadi Feiran, and at Tur. In others, it is raised by means
of the mechanical device of a water-wheel and by a <i>shaduf</i>.</p>

<p>Rain falls in the peninsula in sudden downpours, often in
connection with a thunderstorm. When we camped in the
Wadi Umm Agraf in January of 1906, it rained without
ceasing for two days and a night, creating rivulets and a
waterfall down the mountain slope. A week later the valley
floor was carpeted with verdure and flowers, and the thorny
bushes were masses of bloom. Rainstorms may result in a
spate, the dreaded <i>seil</i> of the Bedawyn, which often appears
several miles below where the rain has actually fallen. In the
winter of 1914-15 the Wadi el Arish was twice in spate,
and left extensive pools of water behind. The effect of a
spate, seen on Dec. 3, 1867, in the Wadi Feiran by the
Rev. F. W. Holland, was described by him. In little more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
than an hour, the Wadi Feiran, at this point about 300 yards
wide, was filled with a raging torrent from eight to ten feet deep.
Men, animals, and trees were swept past upon the flood, and
huge boulders ground along the wady bed with a noise of a
hundred mills at work. In this spate perished thirty persons,
scores of sheep and goats, camels, and donkeys, and it swept
away an entire encampment that had been pitched at the
mouth of a small valley on the north side of Mount Serbal.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>Disasters of this kind are in part attributable to the
reckless deforestation of the country which has gone on unchecked
for thousands of years, and continues at the present
day. To this is attributable also the calamitous invasion of
sand along the shores of the Mediterranean recorded by Arabic
writers. In ancient times wood was extensively used for
smelting purposes in different parts of the peninsula, as is
shown by enormous slag-heaps in the Wadi Baba and in the
Wadi Nasb. A great bed of wood ashes beneath the temple-floor
at Serabit showed that wood was freely used in offering
the holocaust in a district that is now entirely denuded of
trees. According to the Mosaic Law, charcoal was used in
early times at the Temple service as we gather from “a censer
full of burning coals” (Lev. xv. 12).<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> For domestic use it was
exported during the Middle Ages, and was regularly delivered
by the Bedawyn as tribute to the Pasha in the nineteenth
century. Its export continues to this day.</p>

<p>The heathen past tried to stem the ravages of deforestation
by marking off certain valley floors, the use of which was
reserved to the sanctuaries. Inside this holy ground, the
<i>hima</i>, no animal might be hunted and no tree might be cut
down. Many valleys of Sinai to this day contain one tree of
great age and often of prodigious size, which is accounted
holy and is therefore left untouched.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> But the mass of the
trees and with them the hope of a copious undergrowth, has
gone. At the time of the passage of the Israelites, there must
have been extensive tamarisk groves, since it is the tamarisk
which yields manna, a product well-known in ancient Egypt.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
Its abundance must have made an appreciable difference in
their food-supply. Only a few tamarisk groves remain in
the more southern mountains at the present day, chief among
them the groves of Tarfat el Gidaran. Again neglect has
destroyed the palm groves of which enormous plantations
existed in the Middle Ages. We read of a plantation of over
10,000 date-palms at Tur, and the date since the earliest
times was a staple article of diet. According to Arab tradition
the land along the shores of the Mediterranean was of great
fruitfulness before it was invaded by sand drifts. It was the
same with the numerous fruit and vegetable gardens which
were once cultivated by the monks and the hermits. With
the exception of the garden belonging to the convent, they
have passed away. Journeying across the wide stretches of
the country which were formerly a wilderness and are now a
desert, one wonders if a wise government could not impose
restrictions which would stop the destruction of the undergrowth
and regulate the water-supply. This would extend the
cultivation of the date-palm, the tamarisk and of other food
products, for the Bedawyn, the present inhabitants of the peninsula,
live in a state of semi-starvation. Their various means of
subsistence have steadily grown less with the centuries.
Deforestation has influenced the fauna to the detriment of
the huntsmen. The herds of gazelles which were numerous
as late as the Middle Ages, are few and far between. Pasture
lands which formerly fed sheep and goats were encroached upon
by the introduction of the camel. The transport of goods and
of pilgrims which gave occupation to the owners of camels
during the Middle Ages has practically ceased. The convent
formerly helped to tide over difficult times by means of its
resources, but the advent in the east of the Turk reduced these
resources to a minimum, and the convent is nowadays hardly
able to satisfy its own needs. In the face of this state of
things, it seems worth recalling the different periods in the
past when Sinai held the attention of the outside world and
helped in the making of history. For the recognition of her
solitary ruins, and of her literary wealth still enshrined in the
convent, taken with the needs of her people, may stimulate
effort to inaugurate a new era to the profit of Christian and of
Moslim alike.</p>

<p class="pch">SINAI A CENTRE OF MOON-CULT</p>


<p class="drop-cap04">THE name Sinai is first mentioned in the Song of
Deborah (Judges v. 5), which is dated to about
<span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 1000, and in the story of Exodus. It perpetuates the early
form of belief of the inhabitants of the peninsula. For the
word Sinai together with Sin (Exod. xvi. 1) and Zin (Num.
xiii. 21), all date back to Sin, a name of the moon-god in
ancient Babylonia.</p>

<p>The word Sin appears as part of the name of Naram-Sin,
king of Accad in Babylonia (<i>c.</i> <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 3700), whose great stele of
victory, now in the Louvre, represents his conquest of Elam
(Persia). The acts of Naram-Sin were considered in the
light of lunar influence, for his Annals state that “the moon
was favourable for Naram-Sin who at this season marched into
Maganna.”<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> Maganna, otherwise Magan, was frequently
named in early annals and inscriptions, notably on the great
statues of King Gudea (<span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 2500). It was the place where
the diorite came from out of which the statues were made.
The same inscriptions mention Milukhkha.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> An ancient
fragment of Assyrian geography which was engraved about
the year <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 680, but the original of which is considered
much older, names side by side: “The country of Milukhkha
as the country of blue stone, and the country of Maganna as
the country of copper.”<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> Of these names Maganna may refer
to Sinai while the word Milukhkha recalls the Amalekites who
dwelt in the peninsula. In any case the name Sin goes back
to Babylonian influence, probably to the Semites who were
powerful in the land of Arabia in the days of Khamurabbi.</p>

<p>The constant recurring changes of the moon caused this
to be accepted as the ruler of times and seasons by the huntsman
and the herdsman generally. The Hebrews came from
a stock of moon-worshippers. It was from Ur of the Chaldees,
a centre of moon-cult, that Terah and Abraham migrated to
Haran on the way to Canaan about <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 2100.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> The Arab writer
Al Biruni (<i>c.</i> <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1000) in his <i>Chronology of the Ancient Nations</i>,
noted the connection of Haran with the moon-cult, and stated
that near it was another place called Selem-sin, its ancient
name being Saram-sîn, <i>i.e.</i> <i>Imago lunæ</i>, and another village
called Tera-uz, <i>i.e.</i> <i>Porta Veneris</i>.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>The acceptance of moon-worship among the ancient
Hebrews is confirmed by Artapanus, some of whose statements
were preserved by Alexander Polyhistor (<span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 140). Artapanus
described the Syrians who came to Egypt with Abraham as
“Hermiouthian” (<i>i.e.</i> worshippers of Hermes), and stated
that Joseph’s brethren built Hermiouthian sanctuaries at
Athos and Heliopolis.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> Heliopolis, the city On of the Bible
(Gen. xli. 45), was near the present Cairo; followers of Abraham
were held to have settled there. Athos has been identified
as Pithom. More probably it was Pa-kesem, the chief city of
Goshen. The word Hermiouthian indicates moon-worshippers,
as Hermes, the Greek god, was reckoned by the classic writers
the equivalent of the Egyptian moon-god Thoth, as is shown
by the place-name Hermopolis, (<i>i.e.</i> the city of Thoth), in
Lower Egypt.</p>

<p>Another name for the moon-god was Ea or Yah, who was
accounted the oldest Semitic god in Babylonia, to which
his devotees were held to have brought the cultivation of
the date-palm, an event that marked a notable step in civilisation.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>
The emblem of Sin was the crescent moon, the emblem
of Ea was the full moon, who, in the Assyrian Creation story
is described as “Ea the god of the illustrious (<i>i.e.</i> lustrous)
face.”<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> On Babylonian seal cylinders Ea is shown standing up
as a bull, seen front face, with his devotee Eabani (<i>i.e.</i> sprung
from Ea), a man seen, front face also, who wears the horns and
hide of a bull.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> This representation perpetuates the conception
of the horned beast as a sacrosanct animal that was
periodically slain. We shall come across this conception
later in the emblem worn by the Pharaoh, and in the story of the
Israelites and the Golden Calf.</p>

<p class="p2">The monuments found in Sinai contain information which
points to the existence of moon-worship there at a remote
period of history. These monuments consist in rock-tablets
which were engraved by the Pharaohs from the First Dynasty
onwards over the mines which they worked at Maghara, and of
remains of various kinds discovered in the temple ruins of
the neighbouring Sarbut-el-Khadem or Serabit. Maghara
more especially was associated with the moon-god and was
presumably the site of a shrine during the period of Babylonian
or Arabic influence which preceded the invasion of the
peninsula by the Egyptians (<a href="#i9">Fig. 1</a>).</p>

<p>Among the Egyptians, Thoth, the moon-god, had shrines
at Hierakonpolis and at Abydos in Upper Egypt, and in both
these places he was worshipped under the semblance of a
baboon. He was worshipped also at Hermopolis in Lower
Egypt, but here he was represented as ibis-headed. In Sinai
we find him represented sometimes as a baboon and sometimes
as ibis-headed.</p>

<p>Thus the excavations of the temple-ruins at Serabit in
1906 led to the discovery of several figures of baboons. One
was the rude figure some three inches high which is here
represented; it was found in the cave that was the treasure-house
of the sanctuary. This little figure is similar in appearance
and in workmanship to figures found at Hierakonpolis
and at Abydos, the centres of moon-worship in Upper Egypt.
Several of these figures were found at Hierakonpolis.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> At
Abydos more than sixty were discovered in the winter of
1902 in a chamber at the lowest temple level, where they
were apparently placed when the later cult of Osiris superseded
the earlier cult of Thoth. This took place in pre-dynastic
times.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> The figure of the baboon who stood for the lunar
divinity in Egypt, was doubtless deemed a suitable offering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
to the sacred shrine at Serabit in Sinai, because of the nearness
of this shrine to the centre of moon-worship of the country.
If the figure was carried to Sinai at the time when similar
figures were offered in Egypt, the establishment of the moon-cult
in the peninsula dates back to the pre-dynastic days of
Egypt.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>Another baboon, carved life-size in limestone with an
inscription around its base, came out of one of the chambers
of the adytum to the sacred cave at Serabit, the work and
inscription of which dated it to the Middle Kingdom of Egypt.
The presence of this figure suggests that the Egyptians<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
associated their moon-god with the moon-worship of the
peninsula.</p>

     <div class="caption"><p class="pc">Fig. 4.&mdash;Khufu smiting the Anu before Thoth.</p>

<p>The chief shrine or sanctuary of the moon god in the
peninsula probably lay in Wadi Maghara where mining on
the part of the Arabs preceded that of the Egyptians, for the
Egyptians here fought for the possession of the mines. This
is shown by the tablets carved in the living rock, which commemorate
the Pharaohs from King Semerkhet (I 7) of the
First Dynasty onwards. They are represented as smiters of
the enemy above the mines which they worked. One of
these tablets represents Sneferu, the ninth king of the Third<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
Dynasty, who wears a head-dress that consists of a double
plume which rises from a pair of horns as is seen in the
illustration. The double plume is well known, but the horns
are foreign to Egypt, and recall the lunar horns that are worn
by Eabani, the devotee of the moon-god Ea or ancient
Babylonian seal cylinders. The adoption of horns by the
Pharaoh of Egypt seems to indicate that he has usurped the
authority of the earlier ruler of the place (<a href="#i13">Fig. 3</a>).</p>

<i>Researches in Sinai</i>.)</p>
</div></div>

<p>Other monuments found at Maghara point to the same
conclusion. Thus one rock-tablet represents King Khufu
(IV 2), the great pyramid builder, smiting the Anu in front
of the ibis-headed figure of Thoth who stands holding out
his sceptre facing him (<a href="#i14">Fig. 4</a>). Other Pharaohs are represented
as smiters. But after the Fifth Dynasty the opposition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
which the Pharaohs encountered in Sinai must have come
to an end, for later Pharaohs were no longer represented as
smiters, but are seen in the double capacity of lord of Upper
and of Lower Egypt standing and facing the ibis-headed
figure of the moon-god Thoth, who now holds out to them his
sceptre supporting an <i>ankh</i> and a <i>dad</i>, the Egyptian emblems
of life and stability. Among the Pharaohs so represented
was Amen-em-hat III, sixth king of the Twelfth Dynasty,
who is shown facing the god Thoth behind whom the goddess
Hathor is seen (<a href="#i15">Fig. 5</a>). The interpretation is that the Pharaoh
is now acting in complete agreement with the divinities of
the place. Of these Thoth stands for the moon-god who
originally had his shrine at Maghara, and Hathor stands for
the presiding goddess who had her shrine at Serabit. This
shrine or sanctuary at Serabit is of special importance in the
religious associations of the peninsula.</p>

<p class="pch">THE SANCTUARY OF SERABIT</p>

<p class="drop-cap04">THE existence of the sanctuary at Serabit in Sinai was
unknown to Europeans till the year 1762, when it was
chanced upon by Carsten Niebuhr, who did not, however,
record its name. Seetzen who visited it between 1809 and
1810 noted this as Serrabit-el-Chadem.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> <i>Sarbat</i> is Arabic for
height, <i>khadem</i> signifies slave. But Prof. Sayce claims for
the name a different derivation. In ancient Egyptian <i>ba</i>,
plur. <i>bit</i>, signifies hole or mine, <i>khetem</i> signifies fortress.
Serabit el Khadem thus signifies mine fortress, with the
prefix <i>sar</i>, which probably stands for exalted.</p>

<p>Other place names in the district probably date from the
ancient Egyptians also. Thus the valley leading up from the
coastal plain of El Markha to the mine district is called Wadi
Baba, <i>i.e.</i> mine valley. Again, a tributary of the Baba,
with its valley head close to Serabit, is the Wadi Bateh,
a name which probably includes the word for mine also.</p>

<p>The sanctuary of Serabit<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> at the outset consisted of a cave,
or rather of two caves adjacent to one another, of which the
larger, which has been squared, measures 20 by 10 feet, the
smaller one measures 6 by 4 feet with three steps leading up to
a round-headed apse or recess (<a href="#i37">Fig. 9</a>).</p>

<p>These caves have separate entrances and lie in a knoll
facing a plateau in the midst of wild, upland scenery. The
plateau lies some 2680 feet above sea level, and is difficult of
access on all sides (<a href="#i19">Fig. 6</a>).</p>

<p>To the north it communicates with the Wadi Suweig along
the steep and tortuous Wadi Dhaba, which is marked number
6 on the map. The word <i>dhaba</i> signifies panther, probably in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
allusion to the feline animal which was at one time associated
with the presiding female divinity at Serabit. Another valley,
marked number 7 on the map, leads up to the temple ruins,
with a path passing the mines which contain inscriptions in
an early Semitic script. But it was not along these gorges,
but along a path leading up from the plain El Markha along
the Wadi Baba and the Wadi Nasb that the ancient Egyptians
approached the sanctuary. This path has been included in
the Ordnance Survey of 1871. A rock tablet marked P on
the map, which commemorates the Pharaoh Amen-em-hat IV
(XII 7), lies near the watershed, and this shows that the
Egyptians passed here. A small Egyptian shrine (Q) was also
discovered at the western end of the plateau.</p>

<p>To the south of the plateau, and separated from it by
several ravines and valley heads, extends the Wadi Umm Agraf
which is comparatively remote from the valleys communicating
with the Wadi Suweig and the Wadi Baba, and relatively
close to the sanctuary. The approach to the temple from this
side was unknown to Europeans till the winter of 1905-6,
when Prof. Flinders Petrie and his party, who worked at
excavating the temple ruins, pitched their tents here. A
path was constructed from the camp up the mountain side
to the temple by clearing away the stones. In parts an old
path was re-used, the existence of which showed that there was
at one time frequent intercourse between the sanctuary and
the Wadi Umm Agraf. Some way down the Wadi Umm
Agraf the valley floor is crossed by a wall made of rough stones
piled together, the purpose of which was to mark off the upper
reaches of the Wadi as is seen by a glance at the map. These
upper reaches evidently constituted a tract of land the use
of which was reserved to the sanctuary. A copious supply
of good water is obtainable at a well some miles down the
valley. The separation wall across the valley is undoubtedly
old. A similar wall crosses the Wadi Maghara, which was dated
by Prof. Petrie to at least the Fourth Dynasty. Its purpose,
like that near Serabit, was to mark off the upper reaches of
the valley, which in this case may have represented the <i>hima</i>
or tract of land that was originally appropriated to the
sanctuary of the moon-god.</p>

<p>The plateau of Serabit falls away abruptly on its southern
and western edge, and the stratum here appears which anciently
yielded turquoise. The wish to control access to this turquoise
no doubt originally led to the permanent occupation of the
caves, and we shall probably not be far wrong if we imagine
this in the possession of a clan or hereditary priesthood, who,
in return for offerings brought to their cave, gave turquoise
or the permission to work it inside the appropriated area.
The offerings brought to the cave naturally led to a sacrifice
and feast which, in the course of time, would hallow the
precincts of the place. Prof. Robertson Smith remarked that
almost every sacred site in Palestine had its cavern or grotto
which served to store the vessels and utensils that were used
at the sacrifice that took place near it. No religious significance
originally attached to the cave. But the holiness of the
sacrifice reflected on it, and in the course of time it was
identified as the abode of the divinity.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>The plateau in front of the caves at Serabit served as a
High Place of Burning. Such high places were in use in
Canaan before and after the Exodus. Prof. Robertson Smith
showed how the barren and unfrequented hill top would be
one of the most natural places chosen for the holocaust, and
in this connection recalled the proposed sacrifice of Isaac on
the mountain.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> We read in the history of Samuel how he was
called upon to sanctify the sacrifice on the height, of which
the people would not partake until it had received his blessing
(1 Sam. ix. 12); also that Solomon visited Gibeon, where he
burnt sacrificial flesh and offered a thousand burnt offerings
upon the altar (1 Kings iii. 4). In consequence of the building
of the Temple at Jerusalem efforts were made to draw
to it all the offerings, but the High Places seem to have
continued till the Captivity. They finally came under the
ban of the ceremonial law.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p>The use made of the plateau of Serabit as a High Place of
Burning was shown by the excavations. In front of the caves,
beneath the stone floor of the Temple buildings that were
erected by the Egyptians after their appropriation of the site,
there was found a continuous bed of wood-ashes which extended
all across the temple area and out as far as the buildings
and stone walls on the south, in all fifty feet in breadth.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
Outside the area covered by the stone floor the ashes would
be carried away by wind and rain. In the words of Prof.
Petrie: “We must therefore suppose a bed of wood ashes at
least 100 by 50 feet very probably much wider, and varying from
3 to 18 inches thick, in spite of all denudation that took place
before the XVIII dynasty. There must he on the ground
about 50 tons of ashes, and these are probably the residue of
some hundreds of tons of ashes. The ashes are certainly
before the XVIII dynasty.” In further explanation of the
way in which the sacrifice was treated, Prof. Petrie tells us
that “the fires were not large, as the ash is all white, and no
charcoal of smothered fire remains. No whole burnt sacrifice
was offered, as no calcined bones were found; and some kind
of feeding at the place is suggested by the finding of a few
pieces of pottery jars and of thin drinking cups. These belonged
to the age of the XII dynasty.”<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>The space in front of the caves was fenced in by a wall
built of rough stones loosely piled together, similar in construction
to the walls that cross the Wadi Umm Agraf and
the Wadi Maghara. The temple area which the wall enclosed
varied at different periods. It was finally 200 feet in its
greatest length and 140 feet at its greatest breadth. Behind
the caves across the knoll its course was doubled. It thus
enclosed a vast temenos of oblong form which included large
open spaces that were again partitioned off, besides the ground
that was covered by the Egyptian temple buildings (<a href="#i55">Fig. 11</a>).</p>

<p>Outside the temenos wall and well in view of the knoll,
rough circular enclosures lie scattered here and there on the
plateau, which were made by clearing the ground of stones
and piling these together in the same way as the walls were
built up. These stone enclosures are for the most part four to
six feet inside measurement, a few are larger, and many of
them contain one stone of larger size that was set up at one
side of the enclosure and propped up by other stones. There
were also some uprights without enclosures.</p>

<p>Similar uprights and enclosures are found in Syria; their
devotional and commemorative origin is apparent from incidents
related in the Bible.</p>

<p>Thus in the story of Jacob we read how, coming from
Beersheba, he lighted on a certain place that was holy ground,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
and tarried all night because the sun was set. “And he took
of the stones of that place and put them for his pillows” (Gen.
xxviii. 11; LXX at his head). In the night he had his
wonderful dream and on the following morning he set up the
stone and poured oil on it and called it Bethel (<i>i.e.</i> house of El),
saying, “And this stone which I have set for a pillar (<i>mazzebh</i>)
shall be God’s house” (Gen. xxviii. 22). On another occasion
he made a covenant with Laban in ratification of which he
took a stone and set it up for a pillar (<i>mazzebh</i>), and called his
brethren to take stones and make an heap (perhaps an enclosure),
“and they did eat there upon the heap” (Gen.
xxxi. 45, 46). Again when the Israelites camped in Sinai,
Moses erected an altar, and set up twelve pillars (<i>mazzeboth</i>),
and when they crossed the Jordan, Joshua took twelve stones
from the river which he set up at the place which was known
as Gilgal (Joshua iv. 1-9, 19-20). The name Gilgal in this
case was associated with “rolling” away the reproach of
Egypt (Joshua v. 9). But the word Gilgal signifies “circle
of stone.”<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> In the Septuagint the word generally stands in
the plural Galgala (Joshua iv. 19, 20, etc). If the single
stones (<i>mazzeboth</i>) were set up inside circular stone enclosures,
this would correspond with the way the uprights were set up
at Serabit.</p>

<p>In the course of the Twelfth Dynasty, the Egyptians secured
a foothold in Serabit where they erected inscriptions and steles,
and commemorated the female divinity of the place under the
name of Hathor. A statuette of Hathor was the usual gift
to the shrine of the Pharaohs of this dynasty. Her cult was
at first coupled with that of the moon-god Thoth as the representative
of the neighbouring Maghara, later she appears
alone or associated with the local divinity Sopd.</p>

<p>At Wadi Maghara, Hathor appears on one tablet following
the ibis-headed Thoth, who faces the Pharaoh Amen-em-hat III
(XII 6), as already mentioned (<a href="#i15">Fig. 5</a>). On a corresponding
tablet found at Serabit she is seen holding out to the same
king a sceptre which supports the <i>ankh</i> and the <i>dad</i>. There
were many Hathors in Egypt, for Hathor here took the place
of earlier mother-divinities in much the same way as the
Virgin Mary took the place of local mother-divinities in Europe.
The goddess Hathor in Sinai was generally represented wearing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
a head-dress that consists of a pair of horns which support the
orb of the full moon, and she is described as mistress of the
turquoise land, and later simply as mistress of turquoise
(<i>mafkat</i>). Hathor stands for the unwedded mother-goddess
who appears as Ishtar in Babylonia, as Ashtoreth in Canaan,
and as the Queen of Heaven generally. At Serabit her name
appears in script which may be Semitic. One of these inscriptions
is on a figure of the usual squatting type that
came out of the sanctuary (<a href="#i23">Fig. 7</a>). Another is on a peculiar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
sphinx that is now in the British Museum. Others are on
much-battered steles that were carved on the rock in the
mine along the valley marked number 7 (<a href="#i19">Fig. 6</a>). The name
consists of a sequence of four signs, which Dr. Alan Gardiner
reads as Ba-alat: “Almost every Egyptian inscription from
Serabit names the goddess Hathor, and there could not
possibly be a better equivalent for the name of this goddess
than Ba-alat.”<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

</div></div>

<p>The name Ba-alat recalls Alilat whom Herodotus (<i>c.</i> <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>
450) named as the chief divinity of Arabia (iii. 8), and who
reappears as Al-Lat in the Koran (<i>c.</i> <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 630). Al-Lat had
her sanctuary at Taïf, about forty miles north-north-east of
Mecca, which consisted of a cave in an upland plain in which
clothes, jewels, incense, silver and gold, were stored. The
goddess was held to be incarnate in a white rock that was
afterwards seen lying under the mosque, and which was
described by Hamilton and by Doughty as a mass of white
granite now shattered with gunpowder and shapeless.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>
Appropriated to the sanctuary at Taïf was a guarded and
reserved tract of land, the <i>hima</i>, where no <i>idah</i>-tree might be
cut and no animal hunted, and the reluctance of Mohammad
to dislodge the goddess was shared by the Taïfites, to whom
the gatherings near the shrine were a source of wealth.</p>

<p>Another cave sanctuary at El Nakhl, not far from Mecca,
which was associated with El Uzza, likewise consisted of a
cave with accumulated wealth and owned a reserved tract
of land or <i>hima</i>.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> The arrangement at Serabit was apparently
the same, and proves the Arabian or Semitic origin of the
place.</p>

<p>The excavations at Serabit, moreover, led to the discovery
of temple furniture such as served the “Queen of Heaven”
elsewhere.</p>

<p>Thus several short stone altars were found, of which one,
broken in half, was 22 inches high with a cup hollow on the
top, 3½ inches wide and one inch deep. Another was described
as “well finished, and on the top the surface was burnt for
about a quarter of an inch inwards, black outside and discoloured
below. This proves that such altars were used for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
burning, and from the small size, 5 to 7 inches across, the only
substance burnt on them must have been highly inflammable,
such as incense,”<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p>Two rectangular altars cut in stone were also found, each
with two saucer-like depressions, ten inches wide all over, and
seven inches across inside, which “might well be for meat
offerings, or cakes of flour and oil, a kind of pastry.”<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> According
to a passage in Jeremiah, the Israelite women, who repudiated
visiting the sanctuary of the Queen of Heaven without
their husbands, which was forbidden to them, said, “And when
we burned incense to the queen of heaven, and poured out
drink-offerings unto her, did we make her cakes to worship
her, and pour out drink-offerings unto her, without our
men?” (Jer. xliv. 19). The utterance shows that offerings
in food and drink as well as incense burning was customary
in the cult of the Semitic goddess.</p>

<p>Offerings that consisted of cakes continued in Arabia into
Christian times. For Epiphanius of Cyprus († 403), in his
book, <i>Against all Heresies</i>, denounced certain Christians as
Collyridians, from the cakes which they placed under an
awning and offered in the name of the Virgin.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p>Hathor, however, was not the only divinity whose cult
was located at Serabit. While the larger of the two caves
was appropriated to her, the smaller adjacent cave was associated
with Sopd, who was repeatedly named here from the
reign of Amen-em-hat III (XII 6) onwards. One inscription
of the sixth year of this king named him together with Hathor.
Another of the forty-second year mentioned Sebek-didi who
set up an inscription and described himself as “beloved of
Hathor; mistress of the <i>mafkat</i>-country; beloved of Sopd,
lord of the east; beloved of Sneferu and the gods and goddesses
of this land.”<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p>The special association of Sopd with the Pharaoh Amen-em-hat
III is shown by an open hall that was erected outside
the temple at Serabit in the course of the Eighteenth Dynasty,
the decoration of which caused Prof. Petrie to call it the hall
of the kings. On the inner wall of this building are the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
figures of the divinities and the kings who were especially
associated with Serabit. Among them is Sopd who is seen
holding in one hand an <i>ankh</i>, in the other a staff of justice,
and who follows the Pharaoh Amen-em-hat III.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> Sopd during
the Eighteenth Dynasty was reckoned the equal of Hathor.
For the entrance to a mine that was opened conjointly by
Queen Hatshepsut and her nephew Tahutmes shows Tahutmes
offering incense to Hathor and Hatshepsut in a corresponding
scene offering incense to Sopd.</p>

<p>The divinity Sopd has no place in the older Egyptian
pantheon, and is to all appearance an Egyptianised divinity
of Semitic origin. He is named among the gods who are
favourable to the Pharaoh Sen-usert I (XII 2) in the so-called
<i>Tale of Sanehat</i>, which describes an incident of the time and is
looked upon as a genuine historical account.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> The cult of
the god seems to have gained a firm foothold in connection
with the forced retreat of the Mentu people. For it says in
a nome text of Edfu, “Shur is here Sopd, the conqueror of
the Mentu, lord of the east country, and in Edfu golden
Horns, son of Isis, powerful god Sopd.”<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<p>One mention of Sopd in Egypt is on a tablet of Sen-usert II
(XII 4) that was found in the temple of Wadi Qasus in the
desert of Kossayr on the borders of the Red Sea. On it
Sopd is described as “lord of the eastern foreigners (<i>sut</i>), and
of the east (Neb-Apti).”<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

<p>The description “lord of the east,” refers to the cult of
Sopd in the land of Goshen, the twentieth nome of Lower
Egypt, the capital of which, Pa-kesem, was known also as
Per-Sopd, <i>i.e.</i> the House of Sopd. The amulet of Sopd at
Per-Sopd was of turquoise, which bore out his connection with
Sinai. An Egyptian text, moreover, described Sopd as “noblest
of the spirits of Heliopolis.”</p>

<p>Now the Syrians or Hebrews, as already stated, had a
foothold at Heliopolis since the days of Abraham, while the
land of Goshen, as we know, was allotted to the Israelites.
The inference is that Sopd who had a sanctuary in Sinai, had
sanctuaries in Heliopolis and in the land of Goshen also.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
The study of these sanctuaries shows that they had features
in common with some of the early sanctuaries in Palestine.</p>

<p>The ancient city Per-Sopd in Egypt, known as Phakusa
in Greek, and as Kesem in the Septuagint, is now called Saft-el-Henneh.
The change from Sopd to Saft suggests a possible
origin of certain place names in Palestine, including Tell-es-Safi,
which is situated between Jerusalem and Gaza, and
Safed, which is situated north of the Sea of Galilee. Both of
these were hallowed by ancient religious associations.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-041.jpg" width="400" height="210" id="i27"
         alt=""
         title="" />
     <div class="caption"><p class="pc">Fig. 8.&mdash;Caves at Serabit. (<i>Ancient Egypt</i>, a periodical, 1917, Part iii.)</p>
</div></div>

<p>Modern Safed occupies a conspicuous position on the
summit of a mountain. Together with Jerusalem, Hebron
and Tiberias, it ranked as a holy city of Palestine.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> It is
named Tsidphoth in the <i>Travels of an Egyptian Mohar</i>,<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> and
is Tsapheth in the Talmud, and Sephet in the Vulgate of Tobit.</p>

<p>On the other hand Tell-es-Safi, situated between Jerusalem
and Gaza, was identified as a High Place of Burning by recent
excavations. Possibly it was Gath of the Bible, one of the
five holy cities of Palestine. The excavations at Tell-es-Safi
led to the discovery of features which recall the arrangements
at Serabit in Sinai. At a depth of 11 to 21 ft. the pre-Israelite
ground was reached, on which stood several pillars (<i>mazzeboth</i>),
some of which were enclosed in the largest of several chambers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
that were built on slightly higher level. The long wall of
the chamber which included the uprights, had a break, roughly
in the form of an apse that was 4 feet 5 inches wide and 2 feet 4½
inches deep. A rude semicircle built of stone stood 20 inches
high from the ground a distance of a few feet, facing it.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> This
apse corresponds with the recess at the back of the cave of
Sopd in Sinai.</p>

<p>The likeness between the place names Per-Sopd, modern
Safet in Egypt, and the place names Sephet, modern Safed,
and Safi in Palestine, suggests that the cities in Palestine also
were the site of a shrine of the Semitic divinity who figures
in Egypt and in Sinai under the name Sopd. It is possible
that Sopd is the verbal equivalent of the Hebrew word <i>shophet</i>,
Phœnician <i>sufet</i>, which signifies judge. Among the early
Semites the sanctuary was the seat of justice, and the
priests were its administrators, who, in this capacity, gave
out the pronouncements. As such they were sacred and,
with reference to the joint divinities (El) of the tribes, they
were at first called Elohim, later Kohanim. The word shophet
itself indicates the Supreme Judge, as in the passage, “Shall
not the Judge (shophet) of all the earth do right?” (Gen.
xviii. 25), while the relation between the Judge and His
administrators is indicated by the words, “And the heavens
shall declare his righteousness, for Elohim is Shophet himself”
(Psa. l. 6).</p>

<p>The shrine of Sopd in Sinai and the one at Per-Sopd in
Egypt, perhaps the one at Heliopolis also, served the same
purpose as the shrine at Tell-es-Safi. The priest would stand
in the recess with his face towards the suppliant, who, at
Safi, stood in the low semicircle.</p>

<p>In Sinai the cave of Sopd was adjacent to that of the moon-goddess
(<a href="#i27">Fig. 8</a>). According to information already cited, a
shrine at Heliopolis where Sopd was “noblest of spirits” dated
from the “Hermiouthians,” who came there with Abraham,
while Hermiouthian sanctuaries were erected in Goshen by the
brethren of Joseph. We are left to infer that a shrine of
Sopd, presumably a centre for the administration of justice,
was connected here also with the localised cult of the moon.</p>

<p>Other features at Serabit confirm the non-Egyptian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
character of the cult of Sopd. Thus, on the northern approach
to the temple stood a stone tank measuring 54 by 32 inches,
with a hollow of 37 by 17 inches. Inside the temple area, in
one of the courts which were built in the Eighteenth Dynasty,
stood a circular tank, 31 inches across with a hollow of 25
inches, and another rectangular tank, 44 by 30 inches stood in
the same court, and a further rectangular tank in the hall on
the approach to the lower cave. The disposition of these tanks
was such that the worshipper who approached the temple from
the north, passed the tank outside and the various other tanks
on his way to the lesser cave. The use of tanks outside and
inside the temple, is foreign to Egypt. They are in keeping
with the <i>apsu</i> or stone tank of the Babylonian temple; and
with the regulations of Moses regarding the laver that stood
between the entrance to the temple and the altar (Exod.
xxx. 18). In Jerusalem in the temple of Solomon was a
“molten sea” that was round about, and there were ten lavers
of brass, five on the right and five on the left side of the house.
(1 Kings vii. 23, 38, 39). A similar arrangement prevails to
this day in the Arab mosque. Outside stands the well or
place for legal washings <i>ghusl</i>, and inside is the circular tank
for ablution <i>wazur</i>.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> The tanks at Serabit were therefore
connected with the cult of Sopd, and their presence confirms
the Semitic character of the place.</p>

<p class="pch">THE EGYPTIANS IN SINAI I.</p>

<p class="drop-cap04">THE monuments which the Egyptians erected in Sinai are
evidence of their continued connection with the place.
These were examined and studied in the winter of 1906.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> They
comprised many monuments which were carved in the living
rock, and were found in the Wadi Maghara, the Wadi Nasb
and at Serabit. At Serabit, moreover, there were found
numerous offerings consisting of statuettes, vases, pottery,
and other objects which were brought from Egypt to the
sanctuary. Outside this sanctuary the Egyptians set up
steles near the holy caves and on the neighbouring hillside,
and they built chambers and porticoes inside the temenos,
and covered these with scenes and inscriptions. Thus the
buildings outside the caves went on increasing till the place
assumed the appearance of a vast temple.</p>

<p>The baboon figure which was discovered in the temple of
Serabit, and the turquoise that was found in early graves in
Egypt, show that the Egyptians came to the peninsula in
pre-dynastic days. The beginning of dynastic history in
Egypt was dated by Prof. Breasted (1909) to about <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 3400,<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>
and by Prof. Petrie (1914) to about <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 5500. Scholars are
more and more inclining to accept the earlier date.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the First Dynasty the Egyptians had
secured a firm foothold in the peninsula, as is shown by the
inscriptions on the living rock of the Pharaohs of this dynasty.
These rock-inscriptions are close to the mine holes in the
hillside about 170 feet above the valley floor. Besides these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
there were many inscriptions of kings of the Third, Fifth and
Sixth Dynasties. They were known to Europeans in the
eighteenth century, and some were drawn and described.
But their importance was not fully recognised and many
perished in the blasting, when the search for turquoise was
renewed in the nineteenth century. Among those which
were ruthlessly destroyed was the great tablet of King Khufu
(IV 2), here reproduced. A full record was therefore made
of those which remained in 1906, and, in order to save the
tablets, they were removed to the Museum in Cairo. One
only was left <i>in situ</i>. It was the oldest of all, dating from
King Semerkhet (I 7), seventh king of the First Dynasty,
which is engraved on the rock 394 feet above the valley floor
in a position which seems to guarantee its safety.</p>

<p>The earliest tablets in the Wadi Maghara represented
the Pharaoh under three aspects: as king of Upper Egypt,
as king of Lower Egypt, and as smiter of the enemy who
crouches before him. There is, at first, little wording beside
the names and the titles of the king. As a smiter the king
holds a mace in one hand and a staff in the other, and the
enemy has a bold cast of countenance, abundant hair, a
peaked beard, and wears a loin-cloth. The Pharaoh holds
him by the top-knot, together with a carved object which
he seems to have taken from him. This may be a feather;
possibly it is a boomerang or throwstick.</p>

<p>The rock inscription of Semerkhet was worked by cutting
away the face, and leaving the figures and the hieroglyphs
standing in relief. A little in front of the scenes, and worked
on the same scale, was the general of the expedition, who
wears no distinctive dress, but the word <i>Mer-meshau</i> (leader
of troops), written in hieroglyphs, is before him. He is without
head-dress and carries arrows and a bow of the double-curved
Libyan type.</p>

<p>Semerkhet was probably not the first Pharaoh who worked
in Sinai. For a small plaque found at Abydos represents
Den-Setui, an earlier king of the First Dynasty, who is seen in
the same attitude as the Pharaohs on the Sinai rock tablets,
and the cast of countenance of the enemy is also the same.<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

<p>Little is known of King Semerkhet outside Sinai. It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
supposed that the First Dynasty at his time was weakening.
No records in Sinai mention kings of the Second Dynasty,
who were indigenous to the Nile valley, and whose energies
were devoted to reconstructing the older elements of government
at home.</p>

<p>A new spirit arose with the kings of the Third Dynasty, of
whom Sanekht (III 1) was represented at Wadi Maghara in
the usual scenes with the addition of the jackal-nome standard,
one of the earliest represented in Egypt, which may refer to
the troops that accompanied his expedition. The face of
Sanekht is strongly Ethiopian in character, not unlike the
present Sudanys. The jackal-nome standard appears also
on the tablet of Zeser (III 2), the next Pharaoh recorded, who
was seen in the regular group of smiting with the addition of
the familiar titles, “giver of purity, stability, life, gladness
for ever.”<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

<p>The intercourse between Egypt and Sinai found a new
development under Sneferu (III 9), who was represented
wearing the horned head-dress mentioned above, and the
wording of his tablet described him as “Great god ravaging
the lands,” here reproduced. Sneferu worked not only at
Maghara, but was in contact also with the sanctuary at
Serabit. To this he presented the figure of a hawk, his
favourite emblem, worked in grey limestone, which was
discovered in the winter of 1906 in the sacred cave itself.
Its work and inscription mark it as a contemporary monument.
It is now in the British Museum. Later ages looked upon
Sneferu as especially connected with Sinai, reckoning him as
one of the protecting divinities of the place, and his haul in
turquoise was referred to in the Twelfth Dynasty as exceptional.
“I obtained more turquoise than any man since Sneferu.”<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>
The value which was set on turquoise in Egypt during his
reign is shown by one of the so-called <i>Tales of the Magicians</i>,
which relates how the damsels of the harim of Sneferu went
rowing on the lake. One dropped her jewel of “new turquoise”
into the water, which was recovered by magical
means.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>

<p>The next Pharaoh who was commemorated at Maghara<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
was Khufu (IV 2), the great pyramid builder, who, as already
mentioned, was figured smiting the enemy before the ibis-headed
figure of the god Thoth. At Maghara several tablets
recorded him, which were of large size and of excellent workmanship.
The chief one had fortunately been drawn and
photographed before it was entirely smashed during the
recent blasting. On this tablet, the Pharaoh, here named
Khnumu-Khufu, was described as a smiter of the Anu, a
word written with three pillar signs, with a man as a determinative
(<a href="#i14">Fig. 4</a>).</p>

<p>Next in date at Maghara was the tablet of Sahura (V 2),
which was framed by a colossal <i>Uas</i>-sceptre on either side
and a row of stars along the top. Sahura was described in
the wording as “smiter of the Mentu.” The same words
were used to describe Ra-en-user (V 6), whose tablet at Maghara
measured 63 by 102 inches, and was the largest of all.
This tablet has the additional feature of an enormous vase
supported by two <i>ankhs</i> with the words: “The lord of foreign
lands (<i>neb Setui</i>) gave coolness,” which suggests that a water
supply was made accessible by some local sheykh.</p>

<p>The Pharaohs at Maghara, between the First and the Fourth
Dynasties, were always represented as smiters. The tablets
of the Fifth and Sixth Dynasties are for the most part broken
or destroyed, but what is left of them points to more peaceful
relations, and records the mining expeditions with additional
detail.</p>

<p>Thus the tablet of Dadkara (V 8) states that the expedition
(<i>upt</i>) was sent in the year after the fourth cattle census,
which dates it to the eighth or ninth year of the reign of this
king. Again, a tablet of Pepy I (VI 3) was dated by “the
year after the eighteenth cattle census”. These tablets,
moreover, mention some of the dignitaries who took part in
the expedition. That of Dadkara named the ship-captain
Nenekt-Khentikhet; that of Pepy I the ship-captain Ibdu;
a further one of Pepy II (VI 5) the ship-captain Benkeneph.<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>
This shows that the Egyptians approached the mine-land by
water. There is mention on these tablets also of princes,
of scribes, of a commander of recruits (<i>hez-uz-neferu</i>), of
inspectors (<i>uba</i>), of interpreters of princes (<i>sehez-saru</i>), of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
seal-bearer to the god (<i>neter sahu</i>), of a chief of the land
(<i>mer ta</i>), of a chief of the storehouse (<i>mer ab</i>), of a chief of
the elders (<i>mer uru</i>), and of others, which shows how carefully
the expeditions were organised. The tablet of Dadkara,
moreover, mentions for the first time the <i>Fkat</i> country, <i>fkat</i>
being short for <i>mafkat</i>, the ancient Egyptian word for turquoise.
There is always a difficulty in reading aright the
names of precious stones. <i>Mafkat</i> was often rendered as
malachite, and it needed the turning over of the rubbish
heaps at Serabit and the discovery of turquoise, in order
fully to establish the nature of the stone that was the product
of the area appropriated to “Hathor of Mafkat.”</p>

<p>The close of the Sixth Dynasty brought a break in the
relations between Egypt and Sinai, which is attributable, no
doubt, to changes in Egypt itself, of which we know little at
this period. Perhaps there were movements among the people
of the east. Among those who threatened Egypt from this
side were the Mentu, who were Asiatics, and whose successful
defeat was achieved, as mentioned above, with the help of the
devotees to Sopd.</p>

<p>The Egyptians probably resumed work in Sinai during
the Eleventh Dynasty, since workmen’s pots, found in the
Wadi Maghara, are dated to this dynasty by their style.<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>
The reign may have been that of Mentu-hotep III (XI 7), for
a group of four kings seated at a table carved in stone was
discovered at Serabit, with the names of the kings along the
edge of the table on which their hands were placed. They
were Sneferu (probably), Mentu-hotep III (XI 7), Amen-em-hat
I (XII 1), and his son Sen-usert (XII 2), who was probably
the donor of the group.<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

<p>When work was resumed in Sinai in the Eleventh Dynasty,
the attitude of the Egyptians towards Serabit had undergone
a marked change. In early days they had approached the
sanctuary as quasi-worshippers, presenting offerings such as
the baboon and the hawk. Now the sanctuary itself was
drawn within the sphere of their influence, and they erected
uprights or <i>mazzeboth</i> on the approach to the cave on which
they recorded their mining expeditions.</p>

<p>Uprights of this kind are entirely unknown in Egypt.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
The <i>mazzeboth</i> erected by the Egyptians in Sinai were therefore
set up in deference to the custom of the place. They were
worked in red sandstone which was quarried on the north side
of the temple height judging by a great square cutting that
remains there, and the work of inscribing them was done <i>in
situ</i> by Egyptian stone-cutters who were attached to the
expeditions. These steles are for the most part 6 to 12 feet
high, 2 to 4 feet broad, and 6 to 8 inches thick. Their tops
are rounded, which gives them the appearance of gravestones,
and this led some of the earlier travellers to describe
the height of Serabit as a place of burial.</p>

<p>The oldest of the <i>mazzeboth</i> were erected on a prominent
spot outside the temenos within sight of the sanctuary;
later these steles were placed along the approach to the cave,
more and more crowding the adytum. These Egyptian
inscribed <i>mazzeboth</i> all have a flat stone at the base which
suggests a place of offering, and their purpose seems to have
been to recommend the members of the expedition who set
up the stone to the good graces of Hathor of Mafkat.</p>

<p>In keeping with this, a statuette of Hathor was presented
to the shrine by the Pharaohs of the Twelfth Dynasty, every
one of whom organised one, if not several, expeditions to Sinai,
in order to secure turquoise. Several of these statuettes,
varying in size and in workmanship, were discovered inside the
temple area during the winter of 1906; most of them were
sadly mutilated.</p>

<p>One statuette was the gift of Amen-em-hat I (XII 1),
the founder of the dynasty, who erected a portal outside the
lesser cave as was shown by a stone lintel bearing his name,
which was found here. His successor, Sen-usert I (XII 2),
added to this portal as was shown by a piece of limestone
bearing his name. The larger cave about this time was
squared, its walls were smoothed and a slab was fixed inside,
on which were placed the more important Egyptian offerings,
including the hawk presented by Sneferu, and the statuettes
of Hathor. It served also to hold a hawk worked in sandstone
that was presented by Sen-usert himself, which named him,
his queen Khent, their daughter Sebat, and Ankhab, chief
or overseer of the north land.</p>

<p>The same Ankhab also set up a tablet of his own, inside
the cave on which he was represented offering loaves to Amen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>Of the next king, Amen-em-hat II (XII 3), there was
found the usual statuette of Hathor, which was presented by
the ship-captain Sneferu. Inscriptions on a hill at some
distance from the caves showed that the Egyptians now
worked turquoise mines at Serabit on their own account on
land which they had acquired. One inscription was of the
seventeenth year of Amen-em-hat II, another of his twenty-fourth
year. The latter mentioned the “mine chamber which
Men, born of Mut, triumphant and revered, excavated.”
Two steles erected in the approach to the sanctuary likewise
recorded the seventeenth and the twenty-fourth year of the
reign of the same king.</p>

<p>The next kings, Sen-usert II (XII 4) and Sen-usert III
(XII 5), made the usual gift of a statuette of Hathor. The
latter was presented by five officials, including Merru, two
inspectors, a scribe of the cattle, and an Amu or Syrian named
Lua or Luy, “a name which corresponds to the Semitic Lévy.”<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>
This shows a Semite in actual contact with the place. A
stele of the same Pharaoh stood in a knoll of hæmatite on the
plateau, the exposed position of which caused it to fall and
crumble long ago; its remains strew the ground.</p>

<p>The reign of the next Pharaoh, Amen-em-hat III (XII 6),
marked a climax in the intercourse of Egypt and Sinai.
Of the forty-four years of his reign, at least fourteen witnessed
expeditions to Sinai, which were commemorated by inscriptions
set up in Wadi Maghara, in Wadi Nasb, and at Serabit.</p>

<p>A great inscription of the second year, mentioned above,
stands on a boulder at the entrance to Wadi Maghara, which
shows the king facing the ibis-headed Thoth and Hathor,
and the accompanying wording mentions Khenti-hotep
Khenemsu, who was commissioned to fetch turquoise and
copper, and who had with him 734 men. Another inscription
was set up by Harnakt, who “crossed the sea and secured
stones of great excellence.”<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>

<p>At Serabit also Amen-em-hat III was commemorated by
many inscriptions. Large stone steles, set up on the plateau,
recorded the 4th, 8th, 13th, 23rd, 30th, 44th, and 45th year
of this reign. Several of these steles mention by name the
Retennu people, of whom we now hear for the first time in Sinai.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

     <div class="caption"><p class="pc">Fig. 9.&mdash;Upper half of Stele of Amen-em-hat III. (Petrie: <i>Researches
in Sinai</i>.)</p>
</div></div>

<p>The stele of the fourth year contained in two columns the
names and titles of over a hundred persons who took part in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
the expedition. The names start in fairly large hieroglyphs
at the top, and diminish in size lower down. A few
additional names were roughly inscribed along the edge of
the stele as the result of an afterthought. This splendid
stele stood about ten feet high in the approach to the temple,
but, worn through at the base by the continued action of
wind and rain, it fell, and snapped in two in the falling
(<a href="#i37">Fig. 9</a>).</p>

<p>Not far from this stele stood one that was set up by
Horoura, describing an expedition which reached the mines
in hot weather. “The desert burnt like summer; the mountains
burnt like fire; the vein seemed exhausted; the overseer
questioned the miners; the skilled workers who knew
the mine replied, There is turquoise to all eternity in the
mountain, and at that moment it appeared.”<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

<p>The reference is to the turquoise mines opened by Amen-em-hat
II, which were now further developed. The neck of
rock which contained the turquoise had hitherto been worked
from the north. This neck of rock was now attacked from
the south, and, as the work became complex, a shaft of about
ten feet square was sunk from above, which brought light
and air into the passages. This shaft was wrongly described
by some travellers as a reservoir. The passages eventually
extended about 220 feet into the rock. A great inscription
on the rock, near the chief opening, gives an idea of the offerings
which the Egyptians made at the sanctuary at this time;
evidently in return for the permission to work here. It
mentions “a thousand loaves, jars of beer, cattle, fowls,
incense, ointment, and everything on which the gods live.”
The offerings in this case were presented by Sebek-her-heb,
chief chamberlain, who declared, “I excavated a mine-chamber
for my lord, the workmen came in full quota, never
was there any neglect.”<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p>

<p>The same Sebek-her-heb erected the stele of the 44th year
of Amen-em-hat III on the plateau. It is inscribed on one
side only and stands in a rough stone enclosure with a flat
stone at the base. The inscription runs “a royal offering
to Hathor, mistress of turquoise (<i>mafkat</i>), for the family
spirit (<i>ka</i>) of the chief chamberlain Sebek-her-heb, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
<i>ka</i> of the seal-bearer, deputy of the overseer of seal-bearers,
Kemnaa, born of Ka-hotep.”<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>

<p>Another inscription of the 45th year of Amen-em-hat III,
named Ptahwer, triumphant, who described himself as
“delivering the Anu Sut (eastern foreigners) to the Pharaoh,
and bringing the Mentu to the halls of the king.”<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></p>

<p>During the reign of Amen-em-hat III the caves at Serabit
were re-modelled to their present shape. The larger cave,
without the recesses, now measures 20 by 10 feet. A square
pillar of rock was left standing in its centre as a support to
the roof. On one side of this pillar the Pharaoh was represented
facing the goddess Hathor, wearing a high head-dress,
who held out to him a sceptre. Beneath this scene Khenum-su,
Ameny-seneb, seal-bearer, and other officials were seen.<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a>
The walls of the cave at the same time were smoothed and
inscribed with mortuary prayers. But their surface for the
most part has crumbled away, perhaps owing to intentional
desecration, and the inscriptions are lost.</p>

<p>Ameny-seneb who was represented on the squared pillar,
also set up in the cave an altar in the name of his king. This
altar measured 40 by 26 inches, and probably stood at the
back of the cave in a recess of corresponding dimensions.
It was found in another part of the cave. This altar had the
ordinary appearance of an Egyptian altar and was worked
in the red sandstone of the place. It apparently took the
place of an earlier stone or altar of different appearance, fragments
of which were also found inside the cave. The smashing
of this altar also points to an intentional desecration of the
place.</p>

<p>The smaller cave which was appropriated to Sopd, was
probably re-arranged at the same time. There was here no
sign of inscription or tablet. It was simply a rounded apse
with three steps leading up to it.</p>

<p>The other work which was done during the reign of Amen-em-hat
III included mining in the Wadi Nasb, where an
inscription at the head of the valley recorded his 20th year.<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p>

<p>The head of the valley floor of the Wadi Nasb is covered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
with an enormous mass of slag, which points to extensive
copper smelting. The mass of slag is 6 to 8 feet deep, 300 feet
wide, and extends about 500 feet down the valley. It “may
amount to 100,000 tons.” The provenance of the copper
that was smelted here is insufficiently known. It can hardly
have been brought up from the mines in the Wadi Khalig.
But even at Serabit, now entirely denuded of trees, a crucible
was found.</p>

<p>After the long reign of Amen-em-hat III came the short
reign of Amen-em-hat IV (XII 7), the last king of his dynasty.
An inscription in the Wadi Maghara recorded work done there
in his sixth year, and, at Serabit, the small rock tablet mentioned
above, was set up on the western side of the plateau.
A portico-court about 10 feet square was also built by him
outside the larger cave. This court was roofed over with
slabs of stone, the roof being supported by two fluted
columns which, like the rest of the building, were worked
in the red sandstone of the place. The walls of this portico
were inscribed, the subject being Hathor seated with the
Pharaoh offering to her, and a long row of officials behind
him. The same scene reversed was represented on the other
side of the entrance. But the surface of the wall has crumbled
so that the general character only of the scenes is visible
and the names of the officials have gone.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER V</h2>

<p class="pch">EARLY PEOPLE AND PLACE NAMES</p>

<p class="drop-cap04">THE ancient peoples and place names of Sinai claim
separate attention.</p>

<p class="pn">The earliest Egyptian rock inscription at Maghara represents
the Pharaoh as a smiter, and describes him as such with
the signs of a hand, an eagle, and the determinative of hills.
The term is held to apply to no people in particular, and is
therefore rendered as “barbarians.”</p>

<p>King Khufu (IV 2), in addition, is described as a smiter of
the Anu; the word is written with the pillar sign. The word
Anu was applied in Egypt to cave-dwellers generally, more
especially to those of Nubia. The Anu are first mentioned
on the Palermo Stone in connection with a king of the First
Dynasty whose name is broken away, but who was probably
King Den-Setui.</p>

<p>In the estimation of the historian Josephus (<i>c.</i> <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 60),
the inhabitants of Sinai at the time of Moses were cave-dwellers,
for he stated that Moses, in going to Sinai, went
among the “troglodytes” (<i>Antiq.</i>, ii. 11).</p>

<p>Among the early inhabitants of the peninsula were the
Horites. The Babylonian kings who fought against the four
kings of southern Syria who revolted in the time of Abraham,
“smote the Rephaims in Ashteroth Karnaim, and the Zuzims
in Ham, and the Emims in Shaveh-Kiriathaim, and the Horites
in their mount Seir unto El Paran, which is by the wilderness”
(Gen. xiv. 5-6). This associates the Horites with Mount Seir,
which extended along the depression between the head of
the Gulf of Akaba and the Dead Sea.</p>

<p>In the estimation of Prof. Robertson Smith the Horites
of the Bible were troglodytes, which would bring them into
line with the Anu of the Egyptian inscriptions. These<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
Horites were accounted of low stock by the Hebrews, and were
probably in the stage through which the Israelites had passed
before they formed a confederacy. Prof. Robertson Smith
pointed out that the list of their so-called dukes (Gen. xxxvi. 20)
is not a literal genealogy, but an account of their tribal and
local division, since five of the names are animal or totem
names.<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> The view that the Horites were cave-dwellers was
based on the likeness between the name Horite and the Hebrew
word <i>hor</i>, which signifies mountain. The connection between
the names is now denied, and the Horites of the Bible are
identified with the Kharu or Khalu of the Egyptian texts.
The Kharu appear in the <i>Annals</i> of Tahutmes III (XVIII 6)
and of Amen-hotep IV (XVIII 10), among the people against
whom the Egyptians fought on the way to Naharain <i>i.e.</i>
Mesopotamia.<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> But the word Kharu on the Egyptian side
has been interpreted as “mixed multitude.”</p>

<p>The next people who are mentioned on the Egyptian
monuments in Sinai are the Mentu. King Ra-en-user (V 6)
was described as “great god of the smiting countries and
raider of the Mentu.” Again, the tablet of Men-kau-hor,
mentioned a royal expedition to the Mentu; and Ptahwer
in Sinai of the Twelfth Dynasty was described as “bringing
the Mentu to the king’s heels.”</p>

<p>The Mentu took part in the great Hyksos invasion of Egypt
between the Twelfth and the Eighteenth Dynasties. For when
the tide of foreign nations was rolled back, they were among
the conquered. King Aahmes I (XVIII 1), after seizing the
foreign stronghold Avaris, “made a slaughter of the Mentu
of Setiu, and going south to Khent-hen-nefer, he destroyed
the Anu-Khenti.”<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> Among the conquered people who were
represented around the throne of Amen-hotep II (XVIII 7)
are the Mentu, who have the appearance of true Asiatics.
An Edfu inscription, as mentioned above, stated that the
Mentu were thrown back with the help of the devotees of
the god Sopd.</p>

<p>The people who figured most prominently in the Egyptian
annals of Sinai were the Retennu, who were mentioned again
and again on the steles which were set up at Serabit in the course<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
of the Twelfth Dynasty. On three separate steles it says that
the Egyptian expedition was sped across the desert by the
brother of the sheykh (<i>sen-heq-en</i>) of the Retennu country,
whose name was Khebdet or Khebtata, and who is represented
riding on an ass which is led by a man in front, with a servant
carrying his water flask behind him. On one stele six Retennu
are named.<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></p>

<p>These Retennu who figure in the annals of the Sinai in
the Twelfth Dynasty are mentioned as dwelling in southern
Syria in the Egyptian <i>Tale of Sanehat</i>, otherwise <i>Sinuhe</i>. This
tale describes how a high-born Egyptian fled when news
reached him of the death of King Amen-em-hat I (XII 1). He
was at the time on the western Delta and by way of the Wadi
Sneferu (unknown) reached the quarries of Khri Ahu (perhaps
Cairo), crossed the Nile and passed the domain of the goddess
Hirit, mistress of the Red Mountain (possibly Gebel Ahmar),
and the wall which the prince had constructed. He reached
Keduma (or Aduma) where Amu-anshi, sheykh of the Upper
Tennu, took him for a sojourner or son-in-law, and settled him
in the adjoining Ya-a country, a land of honey and figs,
where wine was commoner than water. Sanehat remained
here many years till the death of the Pharaoh caused him to
petition his successor Sen-usert I (XII 2) for return to Egypt.<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a>
The name of the land to which Sanehat fled was read either
as Aduma which would be the equivalent of Edom, but more
probably (cf. Maspero and Dr. Alan Gardiner) as Keduma,
and is probably the land Kedem, <i>i.e.</i> the east country, to
which Abraham sent the sons of his concubines (Gen. xxv. 6).
But the Retennu, who were peaceful neighbours of the
Egyptians during the Twelfth Dynasty, were among the peoples
against whom they afterwards waged war. Tahutmes I
(XVIII 3) fought the Retennu on his way from Egypt to
Naharain, <i>i.e.</i> Mesopotamia; Tahutmes III (XVIII 6) again
and again ravaged their country; and Sety I (XIX 2), whose
objective was Kadesh on the Orontes, was represented in
his temple at Karnak dragging after him the great sheykhs
of the Retennu, whom he is shown holding by the hair of their
heads.<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> Again, Ramessu III (XX 1) mentioned the tribute<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
which was brought by the Retennu, in the great inscription
of his temple at Medinet Habu.<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></p>

<p>The Retennu and their name survived in Sinai, for Ptolemy,
the geographer, named as its inhabitants the Pharanites, the
Raithenoi and the Munichiates. Again, in the year 1816 the
traveller Burckhardt noted that, attached to the mosque that
stood inside the convent precincts, there were certain poor
Bedawyn “called Retheny,” whose duty it was to clean the
mosque. One of them had the dignity of <i>imam</i>, a leader in
prayer, and was supported by offerings.<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></p>

<p>And not only did the Retennu continue, the language which
they spoke seems to have continued likewise. The sheykh
who befriended Sanehat about two thousand years before
our era, was named Amu-anshi, as recorded in the <i>Tale of
Sanehat</i>. About the year <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 440 the Christian community
of Pharan in Sinai, in consequence of outrages committed
by the Arabs, lodged a complaint with their sheykh who stood
in the relation of phylarch to the Romans, and who dwelt
at a place described as twelve days’ journey from Pharan.
The sequel of the account makes it probable that it was
Petra. The name of the sheykh was Ammanus, which is the
Latinised equivalent of Amu-anshi.</p>

<p>Another people who were associated with Sinai were the
Rephaim who are mentioned in the Bible among the people
who were raided by the Babylonian kings about <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 2100.
“They smote the Rephaims in Ashteroth Karnaim” (Gen.
xiv. 5). The word Rephaim is related to Raphaka or Raphia
of the annals of Sargon II (<span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 722-50).<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> It lies on the high
road from Syria to Egypt on the Mediterranean. Its modern
name is Rafa.</p>

<p>The Rephaim of the Bible were accounted giants. In
Arabian tradition we also hear of giants or tyrants, the Jababera.
They were accounted descendants of the Aulad bin
Nuh (children of Noah), or Amalikah, from their ancestor
Amlah bin Arfexad bin Sam (Shem) bin Nuh. Masudi spoke
of the giants of the race of Amalekites who ruled in Syria
at the time of Moses.<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>According to Arab belief the Amalekites were inspired with
a knowledge of the Arabic tongue, and settled at Medina, and
were the first to cultivate the ground and plant the date palm.
In the course of time they extended over the whole tract
towards the Red Sea (El Hedjaz), and the north-western
part of the Indian Ocean (El Omar), and became the progenitors
not only of the Jababera, but also of the Faraineh
(<i>i.e.</i> the Pharaohs) of Egypt.</p>

<p>In the Biblical genealogy Amalek appears as a descendant
of Esau, his mother, Adah, being a Hittite (Gen. xxxvi. 2, 12).
But scholars generally are agreed in assigning a high antiquity
to the Amalekites. The prophet Balaam, inspired by Jehovah,
uttered the words, “Amalek was the first of the nations”
(Num. xxiv. 20).</p>

<p>Whatever their origin, the Amalekites were in the possession
of Sinai when the Israelites came there, since they opposed
their entrance and harried them on their way to the holy
mount, and later attacked them in Rephidim, where the
Israelites carried the day (Deut. xxv. 17; Exod. xvii. 8-16).
Later, acting in concert with the Canaanites, they smote the
Israelites on their way to Hormah (Num. xiv. 25-45), and in
the time of Saul they still occupied the land “from Havilah
unto Shur” (from Arabia to the Wall of Egypt), which,
according to another account, was allotted to the sons of
Ishmael (Gen. xxv. 18). Saul waged a fierce war against
them.</p>

<p>The connection of the Amalekites with Sinai continued in
the mind of the Arab, for Makrizi († 1441) speaking of Pharan,
the city of Sinai, described it as a city of the Amalekites.<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></p>

<p>The Amalekites of the Bible and of Arab tradition are
probably the Milukhkha of the ancient annals. As mentioned
above, they appear on the statue of Gudea of about the year
<span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 2500, and in the Assyrian fragment of geography of about
<span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 600.</p>

<p>Pharan, which the Arab writers described as a city of the
Amalekites, was from early times a place-name in Sinai.
According to the Bible, the Babylonian kings (<i>c.</i> <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 2100)
pressed the Horites as far as “El Paran, which is by the
wilderness,” a phrase which the Septuagint rendered as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
“the terebinth of Pharan,” as though it were a site marked
by a tree. Pharan, to all appearance, was a general name
given to the peninsula of Sinai. It is like the name Pharaoh,
and this is apparently the reason why the name “Bath of
Pharaoh,” Gebel Hammam Faraun, is given to a hill near the
west coast, and the name Giziret el Faraun to the island near
Akaba, the idea of the Pharaoh leading to various localised
legends.</p>

<p>In the Bible we read that the Israelites, after leaving the
Holy Mount, passed through “the wilderness of Paran” on
their way to Edom, which would locate it to the Badiet Tîh.
Again, King Hadad (<i>c.</i> <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 1156), on his way from Midian to
Egypt, passed through Paran (1 Kings xi. 17).</p>

<p>The Septuagint and the classical writers rendered Paran,
as Pharan, and Ptolemy, the geographer, named a village
(κώμη) Pharan, the position of which corresponds with the
seat of the later Christian bishopric in the Wadi Feiran.
He also named the southernmost point of the peninsula, the
present Ras Mohammad, as the promontory of Pharan, and
included the Pharanites among the inhabitants of Sinai.</p>

<p>Again, Pliny († <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 79) mentioned a variety of precious
stone as <i>sapenos</i> or <i>pharanites</i>, so called from the country
where it is found (xxvii. 40). Perhaps turquoise is meant, in
which case Sapenos, a word otherwise unknown, may be
connected with the name Sopd; Pharanites would refer to
Pharan or to Pharaoh.</p>

<p>The Egyptologist Ebers was the first to suggest that the
name Paran shows Egyptian influence, and may be the
place-name Rahan <i>plus</i> the Egyptian article <i>Pa</i>, in the same
way as Pa-kesem is the land of Kesem, <i>i.e.</i> Goshen.<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></p>

<p>The word Rahan occurs in an Egyptian inscription of the
Twelfth Dynasty, according to which an envoy coming from
Egypt crossed Desher to the Rahan country.<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></p>

<p>The word Raha as a place continues in different parts of
the peninsula to the present day. The north-western part
of the Tîh is called Gebel er Raha, and the wide sandy plain
that extends north of the Gebel Musa is the Plain of Raha.<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a></p>

<p>According to the Bible, Ishmael “a wild man and an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
archer,” dwelt in the wilderness of Paran, and his mother,
who was an Egyptian, “took him a wife out of Egypt.” The
Septuagint rendered this as “out of Pharan of Egypt” (Gen.
xvi. 12; xxi. 21). The Ishmaelites in the Bible are referred
to Abraham himself, which shows that they were regarded as
an allied stock by the Hebrews, a certain inferiority being
implied by their having Egyptian blood in their veins. The
acceptance of a joint divinity El seems to have made a bond
of union between the twelve tribes of Ishmael, as it did between
the tribes of Israel. According to Genesis the Ishmaelites
dwelt from Havilah unto Shur, “living in houses and castles,”
or rather in “tents and booths,” as the Septuagint rendered
the passage (Gen. xxv. 16).</p>

<p>While Paran in the Bible was associated with Ishmael
the adjoining land of Edom was connected with Esau, the
incidents of whose story are more or less mythical, but a
clue to them is yielded by the word Edom which signifies red
in Aramaic.</p>

<p>Esau was red-haired at birth. “And the first came out
red, all over like a hairy garment; and they called his name
Esau” (Gen. xxv. 25). Again, Esau, in exchange for his
birthright, <i>i.e.</i> herds and flocks and precedence after his father’s
death, took “very red food,” literally the “red, red thing,”
which the Septuagint rendered as “fiery red” (πυῤῥοῦ). In the
further development of the story, the red thing is described
as a pottage of red lentils. “And Esau said to Jacob, Feed
me, I pray thee, with that same red pottage; for I am faint:
therefore was his name called Edom” (Gen. xxv. 30). The
hairiness of Esau has been connected with Mount Seir, a
word signifying rough;<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> on the same basis the idea of redness
conveyed by the word Edom, is referable to the red sandstone
of the district.</p>

<p>The Edomites, according to the Bible, took possession of
the land of Uz (Lam. iv. 21), which was the land of Job (Job
i. 1). Uz was described as the son of Aram, the son of Shem
(Gen. x. 23), or, according to Masudi († 957), “Aud, the son
of Aram, the son of Shem.”<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></p>

<p>Uz and Aud are thus identified, and in keeping with this,
Septuagint described Job as dwelling in the land “Ausitis.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>Aud was a divinity by whom a group of Arabs took their
oath, and the people of Ad or Uz were among the great people
of the Arab legendary past, who were smitten by misfortune.
The calamities which befell them are, perhaps, reflected in
the story of Job.</p>

<p>In the Koran the utterance was put into the lips of Moses,
“Hath not the story reached thee of those who were before
thee, the people of Noah and Ad and Themud” (xiv. 9).<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> “And
unto Ad we sent their brother Hud ... and unto Themud
we sent Saleh, but the people received them not as their
prophets, and they were destroyed” (vii. 63). “And we
destroyed Ad and Themud” (xxix. 38). According to Masudi
(† 957) Aud, who was sent to the Adites, and Saleh, who was
sent to the Thamudites, lived immediately after the Flood,
before Abraham.<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a></p>

<p>Many stories were current among the Arabs concerning
the wealth and influence of the Adites. They were said to
have lived twelve hundred years, when their sons the Shaddad,
subjected the country of the Egyptian, and in this they
remained two hundred years, and built the city Aour or
Awar.<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> The reference is to the great fortress of the Hyksos,
the Hatuar of the Egyptians, the Avaris of Manetho-Josephus,
situated about twenty miles north of Cairo. If the Adites
were instrumental in erecting this city, they must have taken
part in the great Hyksos invasion which happened during
the Fourteenth Dynasty of Egypt, <i>i.e.</i> about <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 2500.</p>

<p>According to Makrizi († 1441), the Adite king who marched
against Egypt was Shaddad ben Haddad ben Shaddad ben Ad,
and the Pharaoh whom he conquered was Ashmoun ben Masir
ben Beisar, son of Cham, son of Noah, whose buildings he
destroyed and in his turn he raised pyramids (probably pillars),
traced Alexandria and then left for the Wadi el Korah between
El Nabouyah and Syria. He built a series of square reservoirs,
which resulted in many kinds of cultivation, which extended
from Raïah (<i>i.e.</i> Raithou) to Aila (at the head of the Gulf
of Arabia) to the western sea (<i>i.e.</i> the Mediterranean). His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
peoples’ dwellings covered the district between El Dathmar,
El Arish, and El Goufar, in the land of Shaleh (along the
Mediterranean sea-board in northern Sinai), where there were
wells and fruit-trees, and cultivation including that of saffron
of two kinds and of the sugar-cane. This land was occupied
by Khodem ben El Airan, when God, because of the over-bearing
of the Adites, raised a storm, and sand of the desert
covered the land they inhabited. Hence the words of the
Koran, “And in Ad: when we sent against them the desolating
blast, it touched not aught over which it came, but it turned
it into dust.”<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a></p>

<p>The Adites at one period controlled the gold and incense
route from Inner Arabia to Syria, and the Koran credited
them with erecting pillars, probably <i>mazzeboth</i>, in high places.
“Hast thou not seen how the Lord dwelt with Ad at Iram,
adorned with pillars whose like have not been raised in these
lands” (lxxxix. 6). And again, “Build ye land-marks on all
heights in mere pastime” (xxiv. 128). Ptolemy, the geographer
(<span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 140), located the Oaditæ to the east of the Gulf of Akaba,
and named as their chief city Aramava, which was an important
watering station on the way between Petra and Mecca.
Aramava is perhaps Iram of the Koran.<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a></p>

<p>The Adites as traders were succeeded by the Thamudites,
who, according to the Koran, “hewed rocks in the valley”
(xxxix. 8). The reference is possibly to Petra. According to
tradition they occupied Aila.<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a></p>

<p>A prophet of the Thamudites was Saleh, who has a special
interest for southern Sinai, since the Benu Saleh, who claim
descent from him, are among the oldest and most powerful
tribes of the peninsula. Saleh in the Biblical record is named
as third in descent from Shem, and as the progenitor of Eber
(Gen. x. 24).</p>

<p>The remembrance of the Thamudites survives in the present
Diar (or land of) Themoud, in north-western Arabia, which
includes the great Wadi El Korah which is followed by the
pilgrims from Damascus to Mecca. In the Wadi El Korah
lie the Medaïn (cities of) Saleh, and some distance south of
these, is the pass which is associated with the destruction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
of the she-camel, the creation of Saleh. For the people of
Themoud to whom Saleh was sent, did not accept him. They
asked for a sign, whereupon he produced from the rock the
Naga or she-camel that gave milk. “Let her go at large,”
was his command, “and feed on God’s earth, and do her no
harm. Drink there shall be for her and drink there shall be
for you, on a several day for each; but harm her not, lest the
punishment of a tremendous day overtake you. But the
Thamudites hamstrung her, and repented of it on the morrow,
for the punishment overtook them.”</p>

<p>This story of the she-camel preserves the tradition of man’s
right to the free use of an animal, which was indispensable to
the well-being of the man of the desert. According to the
Koran, it will be the end of all things when “the sun is
folded up, the stars fall, the mountains rock, the she-camel
is abandoned and the wild beasts are gathered together”
(lxxxi. 1).</p>

<p>In the year 1873 Doughty, coming from Damascus, stayed
at the Medaïn Saleh, where he saw and described the well,
now enclosed in a tower, where the she-camel was watered.
He also visited the pass some way further along the road, the
Mubrak en Naga, where the she-camel was killed.<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a></p>

<p>According to one tradition this was done by Codar el Ahmar
(<i>i.e.</i> the Red), a name in which Caussin de Perceval, saw a
likeness to Chedorlaomer of the time of Abraham.<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> This
agrees with Masudi’s statement that Saleh came to the rescue
of the Thamudites when their existence was threatened by a
descendant of Ham.<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> Saleh and King Djundu fled to Sinai
where they became hermits, and Saleh died and was buried
in El Ramlah. The tomb of Nebi Saleh is located in the
present Wadi Sheykh near the Gebel Musa, and is the site
of the great annual encampment of the Arabs of southern
Sinai.</p>

<p>In the newly discovered annals of King Sargon of Assyria
(<span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 722-705), the people of Tamud are named among “the
Arabians living at a distance in the desert of whom the Wise
Men and the Magi knew nothing, who never brought tribute
to (my father) the king, whom I overthrew, and the remainder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
I carried off into Palestine.”<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> This transportation explains
the re-appearance of the Thamudites in different localities.
Ptolemy knew of Thamuditæ who dwelt along the Gulf of
Akaba, and of Thamudenæ who dwelt further inland.<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> Diodorus
Siculus (<i>c.</i> <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 50) mentioned Thamudeans living in

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER VI</h2>

<p class="pch">THE EGYPTIANS IN SINAI II.</p>

<p class="drop-cap12">AFTER the close of the Twelfth Dynasty, the Egyptians
ceased for centuries to come to Sinai. The reason was
that foreigners, for over a hundred years, ruled in the Nile
valley whom the Alexandrian writers called Arabians or
Phœnicians. The Egyptians themselves called them Hyksos.
To this period probably belong the inscriptions in Semitic
script that were set up in some mines in the Wadi Dhabah
near Serabit, and the offerings of a squat figure and of a
sphinx inscribed in the same Semitic script which were
presented before the shrine of the goddess. These inscriptions
again and again mention the goddess of the place in lettering
which may be Ba-alat, and the script itself is considered of the
highest interest in the study of Semitic characters generally.</p>

<p>After throwing back the foreign invaders of Egypt, the
Pharaohs of the Eighteenth Dynasty once again sent expeditions
to Sinai, where, as we learn from the inscriptions and monuments,
they worked both at Maghara and at Serabit. At
Serabit building was now continued on an extensive scale
outside the caves of the sanctuary. Halls, courts, a pylon,
and a long row of chambers were erected on the plateau
inside the temenos, which gave the sanctuary the appearance
of a vast temple. The buildings were all constructed of the
red sandstone of the place, which was quarried on the hill
slope just below the temple on the north side, where great
quarries remain (<a href="#i55">Fig. 11</a>).</p>

<p>The offerings which the Egyptians now made to the
shrine were smaller, more numerous and, with few exceptions,
of less importance than those of the Twelfth Dynasty. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
included figures, bowls, cups, vases of alabaster and glaze,
ring-stands, <i>sistra</i> or rattles, <i>menats</i> or pendants, besides
wands for temple use, and rows upon rows of beads. Most
of these objects are similar to those which were in use in
Egypt in connection with the cult of the goddess Hathor,
but many bear a character which show that they were made
in deference to the local associations of the place.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-067.jpg" width="450" height="368" id="i53"

         title="" />
     <div class="caption"><p class="pc">Fig. 10.&mdash;Temple ruins at Serabit.</p>
</div></div>

<p>Thus, on some of these offerings, beginning with the
reign of Hatshepsut (XVIII 5), a feline animal appears,
which is sometimes a cheetah and sometimes a serval, and
which was directly associated with the goddess Hathor, as
was shown by a ring-stand on which the head of the goddess
appeared with a cat on either side.</p>

<p>This animal, considering its varying form, can hardly be
intended for an Egyptian nome-animal, such as the cat of
Bubastis. Rather should we look upon it as intended for
a local animal associated with the temple.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>In other parts of the world, the early totem animal was
sometimes associated by a later age with the mother-divinity.
Possibly the animal in the offerings in Sinai was of this kind.
No traditions on the subject are preserved, but the chief
gorge along which the plateau of the temple is approached
from the north is called the Wadi Dhaba, a word which
signifies wild beast or panther in Arabic.</p>

<p>Of the smaller cult objects which now accumulated in the
sanctuary, many were carried off before the winter of 1906,
and are scattered in various museums. But the mass of
the objects that remained was so great that their fragments
covered the ground of the sanctuary and the portico in front
of the larger cave, in a layer two or three inches thick. Fragments
also strewed the ground outside the temple precincts.
Of these fragments several hundredweights were conveyed
from the temple to the camp, where they were laid out and
fitted, but although days and weeks were spent in fitting
them, and many objects had a distinctive appearance, no
complete specimen of any kind was recovered. The explanation
is that the objects were intentionally smashed, and their
fragments scattered outside the cave where they gradually
disintegrated. It was doubtless done from the same lust
of iconoclastic zeal which caused the smashing of the statuettes
of Hathor, but whether during some ancient upheaval or by
the Moslim, who can tell?</p>

<p>Among the masses of fragments as many as 447 bore
cartouches of the Pharaohs, and this enables us to date them.</p>

<p>Thus Aahmes (XVIII 1), first ruler of the Eighteenth
Dynasty, was named on a <i>sistrum</i> and on <i>menats</i>; his daughter
Merytamen was named on a <i>menat</i>; and his successor Amen-hotep
I (XVIII 2) was named on a <i>sistrum</i>, a <i>menat</i> and a
plaque of Hathor. The same Pharaoh’s queen, Aahmes
Nefertari, was named on a <i>menat</i>.</p>

<p>Of these kings, Amen-hotep I restored the portico of the
cave of Hathor, as was shown by a perfect lintel slab with
a cavetto cornice, 22 inches high and 50 inches long, bearing
his name which was found in front of the entrance. His
successor, Tahutmes I (XVIII 3) gave a <i>menat</i> of himself
and his queen, a wand, and an alabaster vase, and pottery
vases. There was no mention of Tahutmes II (XVIII 4).</p>

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>Great activity was shown during the reign of the next
rulers, Hatshepsut (XVIII 5) and her nephew Tahutmes III
(XVIII 6), and their names appear on a large number of small
offerings, including several which show the feline animal.
These rulers jointly worked the mines at Serabit which had been
opened in the Twelfth Dynasty, and at Maghara a tablet dated
to their 16th year stands inside the entrance to a mining
gallery that is about 24 feet long, 60-70 inches wide, and about
100 inches high. It is on this tablet that Hatshepsut is
seen offering incense to the god Sopd, while Tahutmes offers
incense to the goddess Hathor. The large rubbish heaps
outside this mine contained much discoloured turquoise.</p>

<p>A new era now began in the history of the sanctuary at
Serabit. The Egyptians built porticoes, halls, and chambers
across the High Place of Burning, which disappeared beneath
them. These buildings were all worked in the red sandstone
of the place, and were decorated with figures and hieroglyphs
in the formal style of Egypt. The arrangement and the disposition
of the buildings have nothing in common, however,
with the temples of Egypt. Like the Twelfth Dynasty steles,
which were erected in conformity to Semitic usage, the temple
buildings of the Eighteenth Dynasty reflect a non-Egyptian
influence.</p>

<p>A small hall was now erected outside the lesser cave, the
roof of which was supported by two pillars, and the wall bore
an inscription commemorating its building and naming the
god Sopdu. In this stood the rectangular tank alluded to
above (compare plan).</p>

<p>On the approach to this hall was another hall, measuring
about 20 feet square, which in its complete state must have been
an imposing structure. Four great square pillars surmounted
by the head of Hathor supported the roof, with long roof
beams from the pillars to the walls, and short roof beams
between the pillars that carried the roofing slabs. These
great pillars were standing when Rüppell visited the place
in 1817, now only two are left. The colossal head of the goddess
surmounted the pillars, and is full of dignity and strength.
In the centre of the hall, surrounded by these four pillars
stood a great circular stone tank, now broken across.
There was, moreover, a rectangular tank built into the wall
in one corner of the same hall.</p>

<p>Inside the north entrance on the way to the sanctuary,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
Queen Hatshepsut also erected a hall which was roofed over
and open at one side. The roof, in this case, was carried by
four fluted columns, one of which remains standing. The
inside walls of this hall were covered with figures and writing,
which gave an account of its building, and a recital of the
offerings that were made for it. Among the figures represented
were Sneferu, Amen-em-hat III, Sopd, Queen Hatshepsut,
and Hathor. The position of this hall suggests that it served
for the formal reception of worshippers who entered the
temple precincts from the north. It has a wide outlook over
the gorges below.</p>

<p>The building activity of Tahutmes increased, if anything,
after the queen’s death. He set up two small sphinxes in
the court between the approach to the larger and the lesser
cave, one of which was found <i>in situ</i>. They were too large
to convey, and were re-buried. He also built a great pylon
with a forecourt (M), over the doorway of which, was an
inscribed lintel with mention of him. This pylon, which
stands up high among the ruins, at this period formed the
entrance to the temple from the west. It was flanked by
two steles of the fifth year of the king’s reign. An outer
court (L) was perhaps his work also.</p>

<p>Outside this entrance the next king, Amen-hotep II
(XVIII 7) added two small chambers (I H), which were again
so constructed that their western side formed a front to the
temple. He also presented <i>menats</i> and vases to the sanctuary.
Later rulers built additional chambers, pushing the temple
front out further west. These chambers measured about 6 by
10 ft. each, with a seat on either side, and they eventually
extended in one long line from the pylon along the whole
length of the temenos, a distance of about 200 feet. They had
been built under shelter of a break in the hill and were roofed
over. Loose stones were piled up against their walls from
outside along the whole length, which concealed them from
view and gave them a subterranean character. Their purpose
is a matter of conjecture. Probably they housed the guardians
of the sanctuary, and served as an adytum to the cave
of Hathor. The worshipper who approached the sanctuary
from the west, and entered the outermost chamber, would
feel himself in proximity to the cave while he was in reality
a long way off. As the treasures which were stored in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
cave multiplied, the device would help to ensure their
safety.</p>

<p>The erection of these buildings across the bed of wood-ashes
put an end to the use of this space as a High Place of
Burning. The site for offering the holocaust was therefore
removed, probably to a site on the north side of the temple
which had been squared in the course of quarrying stone for
temple buildings. Corn was growing on this site in the winter
of 1906, which prevented its being dug down to the rock.
But the peculiar fertility of the accumulated soil which rendered
the growing of corn possible, suggested that, here also, there
might be an accumulation of wood ashes due to extensive
burning.</p>

<p>His successor, Tahutmes IV (XVIII 8), further extended the
mines of the Twelfth Dynasty, and recorded his doing so by a
tablet which is dated to the fourth year of his reign. Tablets
of the fifth and the eighth years of his reign have also been
mentioned by travellers, but these were sought for in vain in
the winter of 1906.</p>

<p>The next Pharaoh, Amen-hotep III (XVIII 9), also added
further chambers to the temple approach (G F), and flanked
the new entrance with two steles which record mining expeditions
of his 36th year.</p>

periodical, 1917, Part iii.)</p>
</div></div>

<p>The fragments of many beautiful objects which dated
from this reign were found in and near the cave of Hathor.
They included <i>menats</i> and wands, and some cups in lotus
form of alabaster of exquisite workmanship. There were
also pieces of glazed inlay of two colours&mdash;an ancient art of
Egypt which was revived at this time. A find of considerable
importance was the relief, here reproduced, on which
Amen-hotep III is seen offering to the god Sopd who faces
him wearing the double plume; in his one hand the staff of
royalty. This shows that special significance was attached
to the god of non-Egyptian origin at the court of a Pharaoh
who had strong Syrian affinities. The connection was further
emphasised by the discovery of the head of a statuette of
Queen Thyi, the consort of the magnificent monarch Amen-hotep
III. This, in some ways, was the greatest find of all.
In the words of Prof. Petrie, “It is strange that this remotest
settlement of Egypt has preserved her portrait for us, unmistakably
named by her cartouche in the midst of her crown.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
The material is dark-green schistose steatite, and the whole
statuette must have been about a foot in height. Unfortunately
no other fragment has been preserved. The
haughty dignity of the face is blended with a fascinating
directness and personal appeal. The delicacy of the surfaces
around the eye and over the cheek show the greatest care in
handling. The curiously drawn-down lips with their fulness
and delicacy, their disdain without malice, are evidently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
modelled in all truth from life.”<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> The reader will recall that
Queen Thyi also was of Syrian origin, and that Amen-hotep III
and Thyi were the parents of Amen-hotep IV (XVIII 10),
better known as Akhen-aten, the great religious reformer of
Egypt. Signs of a connection of Sinai with the reforming king
himself were not wanting, for among the work found inside
the temenos of the temple was an inscribed limestone tablet,
partly broken, which showed a figure carefully wrought in
the peculiar style of art which was favoured by Akhen-aten
as we know it at Amarna. The figure was Ramessu I, the
founder of the Nineteenth Dynasty, who was described on the
tablet as “prince of every circuit of the Aten,” a title which was
introduced by the religious reformer.<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> The use of the term
is therefore relatively late, and suggests that the adherents
of the religious reformer after his downfall sought and found
a refuge at the relatively remote centre of Serabit.</p>

<p>In the estimation of the present writer, the Exodus of the
Israelites was connected with the reaction in favour of the
older Egyptian religion which followed the downfall of
Atenism, and Moses visited the sanctuary at Serabit before the
rise of the Nineteenth Dynasty. If so he saw it as it was left
standing at the time of Amen-hotep III (XVIII 8); and the
account of the building activity of the later Pharaohs at the
sanctuary should therefore follow the account of the passage of
the Israelites. But as authorities differ as to the Pharaohs who
were in contact with Moses, it seems preferable here to complete
the account of the Egyptian activity in Sinai before dealing
with the story of the Exodus.</p>

<p>Many small objects similar to those brought during the
Eighteenth Dynasty were presented at the shrine by the
Pharaohs of the Nineteenth and Twentieth Dynasties, who
worked extensively at the mines, where the cult of Hathor
continued. No inscription mentions Sopd, whose cult, which
lasted from the Twelfth to the Eighteenth Dynasties, was
now at an end.</p>

<p>Of the kings of the Nineteenth Dynasty King Sety I (XIX 2)
made the usual small offerings, and erected a commemorative
stele on a hillock at some distance from the temple which is
still visible from afar. He added two courts (B and A) to
the row of chambers which extended across the temenos,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
enclosing the stele which had been set up by Amen-hotep III,
and carrying the row of chambers beyond the temenos wall.
These now extended well nigh 200 feet beyond the actual cave,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
the remoteness and safety of which were thereby ensured.
With the work of Sety ended the growth of the temple,
His successor, Ramessu II (XIX 3), rebuilt inner parts of
the sanctuary, and erected several commemorative steles.
He also made a large number of small offerings. Again,
Meren-ptah (XIX 4) inscribed the pylon, carving his name
across that of Tahutmes III, and made the usual small
offerings. Sety II (XIX 6) and Ta-usert (XIX 7) made small
offerings of glazed pottery also.</p>

</div></div>

<p>The last of the steles recording a mine expedition was
erected by King Set-nekht (XIX 9), on the south entrance to
the temple. After him Ramessu III (XX 1) appropriated
to his own use steles set up by earlier kings which he reinscribed
in the way usual to him. He also made many
small offerings, including two vases, cylindrical in form, with
scenes in relief modelled around them in different colours,
which, in their completeness, were objects of great beauty.
Fragments of them only were found which made restoration
impossible. One of these vases was worked in dark grey,
green and light green. “The subject was the king seated,
with a girl standing before him holding a bouquet of flowers.
On the other side of the vase were conventional representations
of two tall bouquets and garlands between them, with
a duck flying above the garlands. Around the top was a
wreath of petals, around the base the usual arrangement of
petals. The smaller vase is more elaborate. The figures
are not only in relief but brightly coloured, yellow on a violet
ground; the petals at the base are green, violet, or white.
The same subject is repeated on opposite sides of the vase.
King Ramessu III is seated, holding the <i>dad</i>; his cartouches
are before him, while a girl stands offering two bouquets to
him.... Such fine relief-modelling is not known on any
other vases, but it belongs to the same school as the glazed
tablets with figures of foreign subjects of Ramessu III found
at Tell el Yehudiyeh. The art of these has a relationship to
that of the finely modelled and coloured reliefs of stucco found
at Knossos.”<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a></p>

<p>The annals of Ramessu III, preserved in Egypt, bear
witness to his activity in Sinai. The <i>Harris Papyrus</i>, after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
mentioning the destruction of the people of Seir of the tribes
of the Shashu (Bedawyn), and the expedition to Punt (Arabia),
stated that he went to Atika and “the copper mines which
are in this place.” Part of the expedition went by water,
and part took the land journey with asses. This had not been
done before. Possibly Atika stands for Sinai. Ramessu also
says, he sent to “my Mother Hathor, mistress of turquoise,”
silver, gold, royal linen, and things numerous as the sand.
And they brought back to the king wonders of real turquoise
in numerous sacks, such as had not been heard of before.<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a>
The same king built the great temple at Medinet Habu, the
inscription of which mentioned as his gifts to it myrrh, silver,
gold, every splendid costly stone, the impost of the Retennu
as tribute, and among the stones lazuli and turquoise.” (<i>Ibid.</i>,
iv. 27-30). The turquoise was no doubt part of the great
haul he made in Sinai.</p>

<p>Of later Pharaohs, Ramessu IV (XX 2) built a porch in
the temple at Serabit and altered the door of the sanctuary,
making the usual small offerings. Ramessu V (XX 3)
was named on some small offerings, including bracelets.
Ramessu VI (XX 4) inscribed the pillars of a chamber (O),
and gave a cup and a bracelet. After that, no trace was
found of any construction or offering made by the Egyptians
in Sinai.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER VII</h2>

<p class="pch">THE ISRAELITES IN SINAI I.</p>

<p class="drop-cap04">THE passage of the Israelites through Sinai forms the most
thrilling episode in the history of the peninsula. The
how and when and where of this journey periodically engage
attention. A hundred years ago it was a matter of common
belief that Moses wrote the five books that are associated with
his name. On the contrary, Biblical criticism now holds that,
“regarded as a history of ancient migrations of the Israelites
and their establishment as a religious and political community
in Canaan, the Hexateuch contains little more than a general
outline on which to depend.”<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> But the study of the episode
reviewed in the light of modern research, reveals an unexpected
accuracy, and once more shows that tradition is of value in
proportion to our power of reading it aright.</p>

<p>Different views were put forward regarding the date of
the Exodus and of the Pharaohs who were in contact with
Moses.</p>

<p>According to the Book of Kings it was “in the 480th
(LXX 440th) year after the children of Israel were come
out of the land of Egypt, in the fourth year of his reign,”
that Solomon began to build the Temple at Jerusalem
(1 Kings vi. 1).</p>

<p>Solomon ruled from <i>c.</i> <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 974 to <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 935. His fourth
year would be 970, and the Exodus, on this basis, happened
either in <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 1450, or in <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 1410 according to the Septuagint.</p>

<p>Prof. Brugsch looked upon Ramessu II as the Pharaoh
of the Exodus. Prof. Petrie endorsed the view, accepting
the date of Ramessu II as <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 1300-1234, and of the Exodus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
as <i>c.</i> <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 1220. One of his reasons for doing so was that
the Israelites, as stated in the Bible, worked at the “city
Raamses” (Exod. i. 11), which, as excavations have shown,
was a creation of the Ramessides. But the expression the
“land of Rameses,” was used in connection with the story of
Joseph (Gen. xlvii. 11), which deals with events that were
long anterior to the Ramessides, showing that the compilers
of Exodus used expressions that were current at the time
when they wrote.</p>

<p>The identification of Ramessu II, a king of the Nineteenth
Dynasty, as the Pharaoh of the Exodus, clashes with the
information reaching us through Alexandrian and Syriac
sources, which suggests that Moses was befriended by Amen-hotep
IV, better known as Akhen-aten (XVIII 10), the great
religious reformer, and that the Israelites left Egypt under
one of his immediate successors. This connection between
Moses and the great reformer of Egypt strikes the imagination,
all the more as it is in keeping with the Egyptian king’s Syrian
affinities. The authorities are worth recalling.</p>

<p>Chief among these were Demetrius Phalereus (<span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 345)
and Manetho (<i>c.</i> <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 260) who were quoted by Josephus
(<span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 80) and Eusebius (<span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 320); and Artapanus of unknown
date, passages of whose work were preserved by
Alexander Polyhistor (<span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 140) and accepted by Eusebius
and the Chronicon Paschale. The information of Demetrius,
Manetho, and Artapanus is peculiar in that it takes no
account of Scripture. Moreover, Artapanus compared what the
people of Memphis and the Heliopolitans preserved regarding
the passage of the Red Sea. Another writer was Philo of
Alexandria (<span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 40) who wrote a <i>Life of Moses</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Chronicon</i> of Eusebius contains the Egyptian dynasties
as derived from Manetho, and in the list of kings of the
Eighteenth Dynasty, Oros stands for Amen-hotep IV (<i>i.e.</i>
Akhen-aten). Against his name stands the entry, “the Birth
of Moses.”<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> In agreement with this, Epiphanius in his book
<i>Against all Heresies</i>, mentioned Thermuthis, the daughter
of Amenophis, who adopted Moses,<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> while the Syriac writer
Barhebræus († 1218), who had access to many sources, held
that the princess who adopted Moses was Tremothisa, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
Hebrew Damris, the daughter of Amunphatisus.<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> The
historian Josephus called her Thermuthis, and related that
she intended Moses for her father’s successor (<i>Antiq.</i>, ii. 9).</p>

<p>On the other hand, Artapanus gave the name of the
Pharaoh as Palmanothis, adding that he built sanctuaries at
Kessa (perhaps Akhet at Amarna) and at Heliopolis. His
daughter Merris who was childless adopted Moses. She was
betrothed to Chenefres.<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> The Chronicon Paschale called him
Chenebron.<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a></p>

<p>Various traditions point in the same direction. Thus, the
Arabs held that Moses was saved by the eldest of seven little
princesses, who were daughters of the Pharaoh.<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> Students of
Tell el Amarna will recall the representations of the little
daughters of Akhen-aten, of whom as many as six are seen
with their parents on the wall sculptures of the tombs. On
the Egyptian side we know that the marriage of Meryt-aten,
Akhen-aten’s eldest daughter, with Ra-smenkh-ka (XVIII 11)
his co-regent and successor, was without issue.</p>

<p>According to the Artapanus Moses spent his early manhood
in the service of the husband of the princess who adopted him,
and led a campaign against the Ethiopians (<i>Præp. Evang.</i>, ix.
27). In keeping with this, Stephen Martyr († <i>a.d.</i> 36) said
that Moses was well nigh forty years old before it came into
his heart to look after his brethren, the children of Israel
(Acts vii. 23). The exploits of Moses against the Ethiopians
were described by Josephus (<i>Antiq.</i>, ii. 10).</p>

<p>The identification of a daughter of Akhen-aten as the
princess who adopted Moses suggests another possible date
for Exodus. The reign of Akhen-aten was dated by Prof.
Breasted to <i>c.</i> <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 1375-1350, and by Prof. Petrie to <i>c.</i> <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>
1383-1365. If Moses left Egypt during the reign of one of
his immediate successors, perhaps under that of Tut-ankh-amen
(XVIII 12), <i>c.</i> <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 1353-1344, the date of Exodus on
the basis of the Egyptian chronology as now accepted, would
be about <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 1350, as against the date <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 1410 or 1450 as
stated in the First Book of the Kings.</p>

<p>According to the Bible, Moses slew an Egyptian who had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
smitten a Hebrew, whereupon the Pharaoh sought to slay
Moses, and he fled (Exod. ii. 12-15). According to Artapanus,
the Pharaoh, after the death of the princess, called
upon Chanethotes (Canuthis) to kill him. Moses, warned by
Aaron, crossed the Nile at Memphis, intending to escape into
Arabia. Chanethotes lay in ambush, whereupon Moses, in
self-defence, slew him.</p>

<p>Moses then dwelt in the land of Midian, where he watered
the flock kept by the daughters of Reuel (called Raguel in
Numb. xi. 29). Reuel befriended him and took him for a
sojourner and son-in-law (Exod. ii. 21). A further passage
states that Moses kept the flock of Jethro, his father-in-law,
who is described also as a priest (Exod. iii. 1), and a Kenite.
Artapanus named Raguel, describing him as ruler (ἄρχων) of
the country, and said that he desired to make an expedition
into Egypt in order to secure the crown for Moses and his
daughter, but Moses refused.<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> Barhebræus says that Moses
married a daughter of Jethro, and describes Jethro as a son
of Raguel.<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> This suggests that Raguel was the father of the
tribe. Philo of Alexandria also refers to Moses’ claim to the
crown of Egypt.</p>

<p>In the service of Jethro, Moses led the flock to the backside
of the desert, and came to the mountain of God, to Horeb
(Exod. iii. 1). Here he found himself on holy ground. The
presence of a priest, of a mountain of God, and of a reserved
tract of land, point to an ancient sanctuary, and our thoughts
naturally turn to Serabit, for many centuries a High Place of
Burning, a centre of moon-cult and a shrine of the Semitic
god Sopd. The wall of rough stones across the Wadi Umm
Agraf marked the limit of the ground that was reserved to
the sanctuary. This would be the backside of the desert
from which Moses approached the mountain.</p>

<p>The angel or messenger of God who spoke to Moses did
so from a Burning Bush inside the limit of the holy ground
(Exod. iii. 5). Perhaps he was set there as a guardian to the
place. During our stay in Sinai the guards who were appointed
to watch over our encampment near Serabit, settled near
some bushes to which they added brushwood, so as to form
a circular shelter, with an opening on one side, and in this they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
spent their time, mostly sitting around a small fire. The
appearance of the shelter from outside was that of a burning
bush (<a href="#i69">Fig. 14</a>).</p>

<p>The Divinity in Sinai revealed himself to Moses in the
name of Yahveh or Jehovah, and subsequently declared
himself the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob (Exod. iii. 6),
“but by my name Yahveh was I not known to them” (Exod.
vi. 3). Considering the connection of Abraham and of Joseph
with Haran and the “Hermiouthian” sanctuaries mentioned
above, their God was presumably the moon-god. The word
Yahveh under which the Divinity now manifested himself,
probably represents the moon-god as Ea or Ya under a
later and more spiritualised aspect. In our Bible the term is
rendered as “I am that I am” (Exod. iii. 14), which recalls the
interpretation by the Septuagint as Ὤν, the Self-existent One.
From the Song of Deborah we gather that Yahveh “came to
Sinai from Seir and the field of Edom” (Judges v. 4), which
leaves us to infer that he had sanctuaries there also. This
explains how it was that during the later progress of the
Israelites, Yahveh spoke to Moses at Kadesh on the borders
of Edom (Num. xx. 7), at Hor (Num. xx. 23), and again in
the Red Sea, and how it was that the prophet Balaam was
inspired by Yahveh (Num. xxiv. 13). Various allusions
render it probable that the cult of Yahveh was peculiar to the
Kenites whose home lay in Edom. Jethro, who befriended
Moses, was at once a priest of Midian and a Kenite (Judges
i. 16).</p>

<p>The representative of the Divinity from the Burning Bush
commanded Moses to persuade the elders of Israel to bring
forth the people out of Egypt, in order to serve God on the
mountain, going three days into the wilderness in order to
sacrifice to the Lord, the women bringing with them all
available jewels of silver and jewels of gold (Exod. xi. 2, xii. 35).
The pilgrimage is called a feast (Exod. v. 1, x. 9), which may
have been similar to the modern Arab <i>hadj</i>, a word which
signifies an encampment or erection of tents. This term, and
the general claims that were advanced, show that it was
question of a pilgrimage to a well-known centre, the thought
of which caused no surprise to the Egyptians. One of its
features was the offering of animals. Such offerings among the
Hebrews were made to keep off the plague; they forestalled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
the sacrifice of the first-born, which was the means they used
to stay the plague once it had begun. The Pharaoh, who was
anxious to prevent the Israelites from going the pilgrimage,
proposed that they should sacrifice in Egypt instead. Moses
refused on the plea that their doing so might be interpreted
as sacrificing the “abomination,” <i>i.e.</i> tampering with a
sacred-nome animal of Egypt (Exod. viii. 26). When the
Pharaoh, further wrought upon, said that the people alone
might go, Moses insisted that they must have wherewith to
sacrifice, and that there must be cattle, since “we know not
with what we must serve the Lord until we come thither”
(Exod. x. 26).</p>

<div class="figcenter">

         title="" />
     <div class="caption"><p class="pc">Fig. 14.&mdash;Men in Burning Bush.</p>
</div></div>

<p>This serving the Lord with animals shows that a holocaust
was in contemplation, and bears out the belief that the objective
of the pilgrimage was a High Place of Burning.</p>

<p>The pilgrimage as planned would have been undertaken
in spring, for the plagues carry us through a year’s course in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
Egypt, with the Nile running red when it is at its lowest in
April; with frogs abounding when the inundation comes
in July; with darkness and sandstorms in the month of
March. Springtime came round again before the Israelites left,
after sacrificing the lamb of the Passover.</p>

<p>Rallying in the city of Rameses, probably at the present
Tell er Rotab, in a marshy valley, they moved to Succoth,
the Thuku of the ancient Egyptians, and encamped at Etham
(LXX, Othom), being led by a pillar of cloud in the day and
by a pillar of smoke at night (Exod. xiii. 20-22). Doughty
describes how on the <i>hadj</i> of the Moslim, “cressets of iron
cages are set up on poles, and are borne to light the way
upon serving-men’s shoulders in all the companies.”<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> The
burning fire at night would naturally take the appearance of
a pillar of smoke in the daytime.</p>

<p>At Etham the Israelites turned south, making for Pihahiroth,
between Migdol and the sea, over against Baal-zephon
(Exod. xiv. 2). Pihahiroth of the Bible is Pa-qahert of the
Egyptian inscriptions, while Baal-zephon is a Semitic name,
recalling Zephon, the god of darkness. Pihahiroth and
Baal-zephon lay west and east of the branch of the Red Sea
which at this time extended so far north as to include the
present Bitter Lakes. Here, owing to the blowing of the
east-wind (LXX, south wind), the waters went back and the
Israelites crossed (Exod. xiv. 21), at a spot which should be
sought some thirty miles north of Suez. They continued to
move south three days, through the wilderness of Shur, stopping
first at Marah, where the waters were sweetened, and then at
Elim, with its twelve wells and seventy palm-trees. Elim
has been identified as the Carandara of Pliny (vi. 23), the
Arandara of the lady Etheria (of about <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 450), who described
how the waters disappeared into the ground and reappeared,
which applies to the present Wadi Gharandel. If this
identification be correct, the fountain which Moses changed
from bitter to sweet presumably lay about half-way between
Baal-zephon and Wadi Gharandel, where the present Ayun
Musa or Wells of Moses are found; possibly it lay nearer
to the Bitter Lake.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-085.jpg" width="450" height="553" id="i71"
         alt=""
         title="" />
     <div class="caption"><p class="pc">Fig. 15.&mdash;Ayun Musa.</p>
</div></div>

<p>Leaving Elim, the Israelites entered “the wilderness of
Sin, which is between Elim and Sinai” (Exod. xvi. 1). A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
murmur arose because of the lack of food,&mdash;perhaps of food
suitable for keeping the full moon festival, the movements
of the Israelites being timed by the phases of the moon. For
they left Egypt after keeping the Passover, a full moon festival
which comes on the 14th (Exod. xii. 6) or 15th of the month
(Josh. v. 10); and a month later “on the 15th day of the second
month after they had departed out of Egypt,” they entered
the wilderness of Sin. Moses held out the promise of help,
and, as they looked towards the wilderness, “the glory of the
Lord appeared in the cloud” (Exod. xvi. 10). The glory of
the Lord probably indicates the moon. Quails appeared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
between the two evenings. They were plentiful in Sinai in
the days of Josephus (<i>Antiq.</i>, 88), and continue so at certain
times of the year to the present day. Manna was gathered
in large quantities which took the place of bread. This shows
that the Israelites were moving among groves of the tamarisk,
for manna is the secretion which exudes from the tamarisk,
owing to the punctures of an insect during six to eight weeks,
beginning in May. A year later, when the Israelites were in
the desert of Paran or Zin, they again gathered manna at
the same season (Num. xi. 8), and continued to do so every
year during the years they spent in the wilderness (Exod. xvi.
35). Manna appears under the name <i>mennu</i> in the contemporary
records of Egypt, and is still collected in Sinai
and exported.</p>

<p>The Israelites were now in Rephidim, the land of the
Amalekites and, as there was a lack of water, Moses was
divinely directed to smite the rock. The waters which he
raised were Massah and Meribah (Exod. xvii. 7); the water
which he struck near Kadesh, a year later, was Meribah also
(Num. xx. 13), hence the place was called Meribath Kadesh
(Ezek. xlviii. 28). A technical term for water-finding seems
to be meant. In ancient Egyptian <i>mer</i> signifies channel,
and <i>ba</i>, as mentioned above, signifies hole, which suggests
a possible derivation. For wherever water percolates the
soil with hard rock beneath it in the desert, it is possible to
reach and raise it by cutting into the soil to the surface of
the rock. The practice is still resorted to by the Bedawyn,
who are adepts at striking water when they are on the march.</p>

<p>In Rephidim the Israelites were attacked by the Amalekites,
who harried them while they were on their way (Deut. xxv. 17).
The place where the encounter took place is not specified,
nor the losses which were incurred.</p>

<p>The number of the Israelites was tabulated in two lists
of the contingents of each tribe which were drawn up, the
first when they encamped before the Holy Mount (Num.
i. 46), the other when they were on the point of entering
the Promised Land (Num. xxvi. 51). The internal evidence
is strong that these census lists, which enumerate the
numbers of each tribe, are a first hand record. At the
same time the numbers arrived at by listing up the contingents
of each tribe, 603,550 in the one case (Num. i.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
46), and 601,730 in the other (Num. xxvi. 51), and 600,000
speaking generally (Exod. xii. 37; Num. xi. 21), are looked
upon as in excess of the population which the land of Goshen
could contain, and the land of Sinai could receive. Poetic
licence or a mistake of the scribe was therefore put forward
as an explanation. Prof. Petrie proposed a different solution.<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a>
The word <i>alaf</i> in Hebrew signifies thousand, but it also
signifies family or tent-settlement. If we read the census
lists as preserved in Numbers taking the so-called thousands
to signify families or tent-settlements, and the hundreds only
as applying to the people, the census lists contain what appears
to be a reasonable statement. Thus, the tribe of Judah,
instead of numbering 74,600 persons, numbered 74 tent-settlements,
containing 600 persons, <i>i.e.</i> about eight persons
to each tent-settlement; the tribe of Issachar, instead of
numbering 54,400 persons, numbered 54 tent-settlements,
containing 400 persons, and so forth. On this basis the
Israelites, at the first census in Sinai, numbered 598 tent-settlements,
with 5550 persons; and at the second census,
on the entry into Canaan, they numbered 596 tent-settlements
with 5730 persons. The numbers 600,000 and so forth are
attributable to a mistake of the scribe who added up the
contingents of the census lists, reading the word <i>alaf</i> as
thousand, instead of tent-settlement.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<p class="pch">THE ISRAELITES IN SINAI II.</p>

<p class="drop-cap04">HAVING reached the goal of their pilgrimage, the Israelites
encamped near the Mount of God, Har-ha-elohim
(Exod. xviii. 5), a word which can also be read as height of
the priests. If we identify this goal as Serabit, it follows that
they encamped near the outlet of one of the gorges on the
northern side of the plateau in the direction of the Wadi Suweig,
probably near the outlet of the Wadi Dhaba. This was the
side from which there was direct access to the cave of Sopd,
and the side on which the Semitic inscriptions were found in
the mines.</p>

<p>The physical features of the place are in closest agreement
with the requirements of Scripture. For here is “a mountain
with a wilderness at its foot, rising so sharply that its base
could be fenced in while yet it was easily ascended, and its
summit could be seen by a multitude from below.”<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a></p>

<p>If we go from the sanctuary down in the direction of the
Wadi Dhaba and turning back, look up, we see the temple
ruins standing against the skyline, with the square cutting,
where the holocaust at this period presumably took place,
just below it to the right.</p>

<p>When the Israelites were encamped, Moses was sought by
Jethro, the priest, who carried out the choice of an animal
and “took a burnt offering and sacrifices for God” (Exod.
xviii. 12). Moses himself ascended the Mount, and after his
return sanctified the people, who were now called upon to
practise abstinence during three days, avoiding their wives,
and washing their clothes against the third day, when “the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
Lord will come down in the sight of all the people upon Mount
Sinai” (Exod. xix. 11). This arrangement was apparently
part of a widespread Semitic usage, for in the Koran we read
of similar restrictions for the three days preceding the appearance
of the new moon (Koran, ii. 193).</p>

<p>On the third day there were “thunders and lightnings,” or
rather, “voices and flashes,” and the sound of a trumpet (Exod.
xix. 16), and the people were led out by Moses and stood on
the nether part of the Mount from where they witnessed the
theophany. Fire appeared first, then smoke (Deut. v. 23),
which shows that they were out before daybreak. “And
Mount Sinai was altogether on a smoke, because the Lord
descended upon it in fire: and the smoke thereof ascended as
the smoke of a furnace, and the whole mount quaked greatly”
(Exod. xix. 18). The voice of the trumpet waxing louder,
Moses spoke and God answered him by a voice (Exod. xix. 19),
whereupon he went up and was charged to set bounds about
the Mount. On his return he declared to the people the
statutes and judgments (Deut. v. 1; Exod. xx. 1), which were
vouchsafed to him.</p>

<p>The ceremony points to a well-established ritual which
has its roots deep down in Semitic usage. For a trumpet of
horn was sounded on special occasions among the Hebrews long
before the Exodus. “Blow up the trumpet (<i>shophar</i>) in the
new moon in the time appointed, on our solemn feast day.
For this was a statute for Israel and a law of the God of Jacob.
This he ordained in Joseph for a testimony, when he went
out through the land of Egypt, where I heard a language that
I understood not” (Psa. lxxxi. 3-5).</p>

<p>In the Moslim world, nowadays, it falls to the <i>mu-ezzin</i> to
call the announcement or prayer (the <i>azan</i>) from the tower
of the mosque in the early morning, when a man of piety may
respond.<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a></p>

<p>The theophany on high bearing witness to the presence
of the Divinity, Moses prepared for the tribal sacrifice below
by erecting an altar and setting up twelve pillars (<i>mazzeboth</i>).
The young men slew the oxen, and Moses sprinkled the blood
on the pillars and the people. Then, taking with him three
priests and seventy elders, he went up into the mountain.
“And they saw the God of Israel, and there was under His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
feet as it were a paved work of sapphire stone and as it were
the very heaven for clearness” (Exod. xxiv. 10, 11). And
they ate and they drank there.</p>

<p>We read that Moses’ second stay in the Mount lasted forty
days and forty nights, during which he fasted (Exod. xxxiv. 28).
The Moslim identified this fast as Ramadan, which, before
Mohammad interfered with its date, happened during the heat
of summer.<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> The Israelites at the foot of the mountain,
probably observed the same fast, since Aaron’s reason for
making the calf was that “to-morrow shall be a feast of the
Lord,” <i>i.e.</i> at the conclusion of the fast, there was feasting,
drinking, throwing off of clothes, dancing and much noise
(Exod. xxxii. 6, 17, 25). In this case it was a question of
a full moon festival, for, on a later occasion, Jeroboam made
two calves of gold, one of which he set up in Bethel and one
in Dan, and ordained a feast on the 15th day (1 Kings xii.
28, 32).</p>

<p>In the Mount, Moses was directed to make a portable
sanctuary on the model of actual arrangements which he was
shown. “And let them make me a sanctuary; that I may
dwell among them. According to all that I show thee, the
pattern of the tabernacle, and the pattern of all the instruments
thereof, even so shall ye make it” (Exod. xxv. 8, 9). “And
thou shalt rear up the tabernacle according to the fashion
thereof which was showed thee in the Mount” (Exod.
xxvi. 30). “Hollow with boards shalt thou make it; as it
was showed thee in the mount, so shall they make it”
(Exod. xxvii. 8). The furniture included an ark or chest,
which contained a vase and two stones, <i>i.e.</i> the standards of
capacity and weight, and the “mercy seat” which was upon
the ark (Exod. xxv. 17). There was also a standard of length,
perhaps the rod of Aaron. The strict adherence to these
standards was henceforth a matter of religious duty with the
Israelites. “Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment,
in mete-yard, in weight, or in measure. Just balances, just
weights, a just ephah, and a just hin, shall ye have” (Lev.
xix. 35, 36). These standards were of Babylonian origin, and
confirm the presence in the Mount of strong Semitic influence.</p>

<p>The ark further contained the two tables of testimony,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
which were cut in stone, but which were so brittle that they
easily broke, whereupon Moses engaged to provide others
(Exod. xxiv. 12; xxxii. 19; xxxiv. 1; Deut. x. 1). The
commandments which they contained consisted, for the most
part, of a prohibition that was followed by a precept. In
this they resemble the commandments that have come out of
Babylonia, which contain precepts such as these, “Thou
shalt not slander, speak what is pure. Thou shalt not speak
evil, speak kindly.”<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a></p>

<p>The tablets were in the “writing of God” (Exod. xxxii. 16),
which raises the question as to the language and script that
were used. Moses, as we know, was “learned in all the
wisdom of the Egyptians” (Acts vii. 22). He was certainly
familiar with hieroglyphs, and the fact that the commandments
were preserved in two texts that differ (Exod. xx; Deut. v.),
suggests that they were written in a language that was not
Hebrew. But the discovery of a primitive Semitic script
at Serabit itself, puts a different complexion on the matter.
The “writing of God” was possibly a Semitic script.</p>

<p>Over and above the commandments, Moses received a
collection of written customs for the guidance of those who
were henceforth to decide in inter-tribal disputes. They are
known as judgments (Exod. xxi. 1), which is in keeping with
their being given out at a sanctuary, where Yahveh was
accepted as Supreme Judge. In the Yahveh cult the pronouncements
were no longer subject to the decisions at local
centres. They were set down in writing and associated with
the holy tent, and it was by accepting the local Baals and
Ashtoreths that the Hebrews fell from the covenant and lapsed
into an earlier barbarism. The discovery of the Code of
Khammurabi and the points of likeness between its ordinances
and those of the code accepted under the name of Moses,
further corroborate the Semitic or Arabian influence of the
religious centres where the ordinances were received.</p>

<p>Moses had many communings in the Mount, and a year
had gone by when the tabernacle was set up “on the first day
of the first month,” in order to celebrate the Passover (Exod.
xl. 2; Num. ix. 1). On the twentieth day of the second
month in the second year the fires were extinguished and the
Israelites moved out of the wilderness of Sinai while a cloud<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
lay on Paran (Num. x. 11-12). They were led by Hobab, the
Kenite. Hobab is described in one passage as “the son of
Raguel the Midianite, Moses’ father-in-law” (Num. x. 29), in
another as “the father-in-law of Moses” (Judg. iv. 11). The
Septuagint renders the term in both passages as “brother-in-law”
(<i>i.e.</i> γαμβρός) of Moses. The terms of relationship are
difficult to fix, but if Raguel be accepted as the tribal father,
as already suggested, Jethro and Hobab may be looked upon
as younger members of the tribe, perhaps his sons.</p>

<p>The first station was called Taberah because of the
“Burning.” Here manna was again plentiful (Num. xi. 8),
which shows that the district was wooded. The next place was
called Kibroth-Hata-avah, <i>i.e.</i> burial place of Ta-avah, because
of those who died of the plague and were buried. Here again
quails were plentiful, which the wind brought up from the
sea (Num. xi. 31). The next stopping place was Hazeroth
(Num. xi. 35), the last station before they entered the wilderness
of Paran (Num. xii. 16).</p>

<p>Robinson located Hazeroth at Ain Hudhera.<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> But if the
original goal of the Israelites was Serabit, they would be
moving in a northerly or north-easterly direction. In the
opening lines of Deuteronomy occur the words Hazeroth and
Dizahab (Deut. i, 1), for which the Septuagint substitutes
Aulon, rich in gold (Αὐλὼν or Αὐλὸν καὶ καταχρύσεα).<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> The word
Aulon signifies ravine, which suggests that Hazeroth must be
sought somewhere along the escarpment of the Badiet Tîh, or
“plain of wandering.” The map of Sinai in a north-easterly
direction shows Wadi Hafera, which has some likeness to
Hazeroth. The Bir Shaweis and the Bir Themed are perennial
wells which the people would strike if they moved in a north-north-easterly
direction.</p>

<p>The next stopping place was “in the wilderness of Paran”
(Num. xii. 16).</p>

<p>According to the Bible, in the first month (<i>i.e.</i> eleven
months after leaving the Holy Mount), the Israelites abode in
Kadesh, where Miriam died and was buried (Num. xx. 1).
Moses once more struck water from the rock, the water as
before was Meribah (Num. xx. 13), hence the name of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
place Meribath-Kadesh (Ezek. xlviii. 28). The name Kadesh
itself suggests a sanctuary, and Moses here again had communings
with Yahveh (Num. xx. 7).</p>

<p>Kadesh appears as Cades in the life of Hilarion († 307),
which was written by Jerome. The saint went there to see
a disciple passing by Elusa (modern Khalasa).<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> There is
Ain Kadeis or Gadeis marked on the modern map. Robinson,
however, sought Kadesh of the Israelites near Mount Hor,
at the present Ain el Waiba.<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a></p>

<p>Kadesh lay “in the uttermost borders of Edom,” and the
Israelites would now have marched through Edom, “keeping
along the king’s highway.” Perhaps the road along the
Mediterranean is meant. “But Edom refused” (Num. xx. 21).
They were therefore obliged to seek an entry into Canaan by
compassing the land of Edom, which meant turning in an
easterly direction towards Mount Hor, and then in a southerly
direction to the Gulf of Akaba, the so-called “Red Sea”
(Num. xiv. 25). An intercalated passage in Deuteronomy
states that “the children of Israel took their journey from
Beeroth of the children of Jaakan to Mosera; there Aaron
died” (Deut. x. 6). The wells must therefore be sought close
to Mount Hor, and may be the so-called Wells of Moses, which
are named as such by the mediæval pilgrims. The modern
map mentions Wadi Musa, which joins the Arabah coming
from Petra. The Book of Numbers located the death
of Aaron in “Mount Hor, by the” (border, not) “coast of the
land of Edom” (Num. xx. 23). Here the Lord once more
spoke to Moses, which suggests the existence of a sanctuary.</p>

<p>Eusebius (<i>c.</i> 320) wrote, “Mount Hor, in which Aaron
died, a hill near the city Petra.”<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> Mount Hor is the modern
Gebel Haroun or Mount of Aaron, a few miles north-west of
the classical Petra. The district at the time was apparently
in the possession of the Kenites, since the prophet Balaam,
called upon by King Balak of the Moabites, to curse the
Israelites, foretold the fall of the Amalekites, and, looking
towards the Kenites, declared “Strong is thy dwelling place,
and thou puttest thy nest in a rock” (Num. xxiv. 21).
This rock, a term which the Septuagint rendered as Petra, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
probably the Ha-sela (Arabic <i>sila</i>, a mountain cleft) of the
Bible, a name changed to Joktheel after its capture by
Amaziah (<i>c.</i> <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 800, 2 Kings xiv. 7).</p>

<p>At Kadesh the Israelites had been told to “get you into
the wilderness by the way of the Red Sea” (Num. xiv. 25),
<i>i.e.</i> they moved south from Mount Hor. The intercalated
passage further named “Gadgodah and Jotbath, a land of
brooks and water” (Deut. x. 7; LXX, Etebatha). The
modern map mentions Et Taba in the depression between the
Red Sea and the Dead Sea, where Romans perpetuated the
existence of a sanctuary in the name Ad Dianam, later
Ghadiana. This movement brought the Israelites into conflict
with the Amalekites and the Canaanites, with whom they
fought and were discomfited even unto Hormah (Num. xiv.
45; LXX, Herman), perhaps the present El Hameima.</p>

<p>According to Arab tradition, Joshua fought against
Samida ben Hagbar ben Malek, the Amalekite king of Syria
in the land of Aila and killed him. Also Moses, after the
death of Aaron, entered the land of the people El Eiss,
called El Serah, and advanced to the desert Bab. There was
then near Aila an important city called Asabaum or Aszyoun.<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a></p>

<p>This Aszyoun was “Eziongeber beside Eloth (<i>i.e.</i> Alia) on
the shore of the Red Sea in the land of Edom” (1 Kings
ix. 26). It was the port on the Gulf of Akaba which was used
by King Solomon. By way of this the Israelites passed into
the plains of Moab. “And when we passed by from our
brethren the children of Esau which dwelt in Seir, through
the way of the plain from Elath, and from Eziongeber, we
turned and passed by the way of the wilderness of Moab”
(Deut. ii. 8).</p>

<p>A list of stations with further names stands in Numbers
(xxx. 12, 13, 17-30), which affords no guide and confuses the
issues. It is now looked upon as a post-exilic collection of
caravan routes which the scribe who compiled the Book of
Numbers incorporated into his account, perhaps because the
number of stations named in it was forty, corresponding to
the forty years’ wandering. Along some routes it mentions
the stations that appear in the narrative in Exodus and
Deuteronomy, but even here with deviations.</p>

<p>Having passed by the depression near the Red Sea, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
Israelites were in districts that were occupied by the allied
Moabites and Midianites. They entered into friendly relations
with the Midianites; later they waged a cruel war against them.</p>

<p>The frontiers of Midian were always vague. According to
the Bible Moses met Jethro in the “land of Midian,” which
suggests that the peninsula of Sinai was included in Midian
at the time. Midian is called Madian in the Septuagint and by
the Arab writers. Antoninus Martyr (<i>c.</i> <i>a.d.</i> 530) held that the
city Pharan, situated between the convent and Egypt, was in
“the land of Midian” with its inhabitants descended from
Jethro (c. 40).</p>

<p>Makrizi († 1441) described Madian as of wide extent including
many cities, chief among which were El Khalasa and
El Sanuto. “On the side of the sea of Kalzouna (<i>i.e.</i> Suez)
and El Tor the cities of Madian are Faran, El Ragah (<i>i.e.</i>
Raithou), Kolzoum, Aila and Madian. In the town of
Madian there are still to-day wonderful ruins and gigantic
columns.”<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a></p>

<p>In modern parlance the term Midian is applied to the
eastern shore of the Gulf of Arabia, between Akaba and
Muweileh, which has made some writers believe that Moses
went into this part of Arabia, and further led to the identification
of Jethro of Scripture with Shoeib, a prophet of the land
of Midian.</p>

<p>Sir Richard Burton in 1877 visited the ruins of the city
of Midian, the position of which agreed with that of Madiama
mentioned by Ptolemy.<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> The valleys which here cut into the
high plain of Nedched contained the remains of silver, copper
and gold mines, and near the city were great loculi cut into
the rock which were known as the Mughair (caves of) Shoeib.</p>

<p>Shoeib was one of the prophets of the Arab past. In
the Koran we read, “And we sent to Madian, their brother
Shoeib. He said, O my people, worship God, no other God
have you than He: give not short weight and measure:
I see indeed that you revel in good things, but I fear with you
the punishment of the all encompassing day.... And
when our decree came to pass, we delivered Shoeib and his
companions in faith, and a violent tempest overtook the
wicked, and in the morning they were found prostrate in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
their houses as if they had never dwelt in them. Was not
Madian swept off even as Themoud was swept off?” (xi. 89).
According to other passages, an earthquake put an end to
the dwellers in Al Ayka, the forest of Madian, who treated
their apostles as liars (vii. 90, xxix. 30).</p>

<p>The name of Shoeib now attaches to the valley in Sinai
in which lies the great convent, and tradition identified Shoeib
of the forest of Midian with Jethro, the priest of Midian of
the Bible. Their identification is said by Sir Richard Burton
to go back to the Arab writer El Farga of about <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 800.</p>

<p>It was endorsed by Eutychius, patriarch of Alexandria
(935-940), who stated that Moses fled to the Hadjaz and
dwelt in the city of Madyan, where Jethro (whom the Arabs
call Shoeib) was priest of the temple.<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> But Masudi († 951),
while accepting that the daughter of Shoeib married Moses,
pointed out that this Shoeib, chief of the Midianites, was a
very different person from Shoeib the prophet, who was
mentioned in the Koran. “There are centuries between
these two Shoeibs.”<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a></p>

<p>The identification of Jethro with the prophet Shoeib may
be due, in the first instance, to the claims which these prophets
made on their people. Moses, who was in contact with
Jethro, received the standards of weight and capacity in the
Mount, the strict adherence to which was henceforth a matter
of religious observance to the people. Shoeib, according to
the Koran, impressed upon the people of the forest the need
to give measure and weight in fairness, and the disregard
to his command was the cause of their destruction (Koran,
lxxi. 88, xxvi. 178).</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<p class="pch">THE NABATEANS</p>

<p class="drop-cap04">THE last Pharaoh whose activity was recorded in Serabit
was Ramessu VI (<span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 1161-1156), after whose reign
information about the peninsula ceased for several centuries.
The road along the north was trodden by the Egyptians when
the country was in friendly relation with King Solomon
(<span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 974-35) and the kings of Judæa. It was trodden also
by the Assyrian armies which invaded Egypt under Esarhaddon
(<span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 670), and under Ashurbanipal (<span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 668-626).
Although we hear nothing of the sanctuary at Serabit its
importance must have continued. For in the list of temples
which made gifts to Nitocris on the occasion of her adoption
by the Pharaoh Psamtek I (XXVI 1), about the year <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 654,
a gift was made of a hundred <i>deben</i> of bread by the temples of
Sais, of Buto, and by “the house of Hathor of Mafkat” <i>i.e.</i>
Serabit, and by Per-Seped, <i>i.e.</i> the sanctuary of Sopd in the
city of Goshen.<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a></p>

<p>In the third century before Christ, Egypt passed under the
rule of the Ptolemies. Ptolemy Philadelphus (<span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 250-247),
a man of wide outlook, built Arsinoë (north-east of the later
Suez) to serve as a port in place of the ancient Heroöpolis,
which was silting up. He further sent out an expedition to
explore the coasts of the Red Sea under the charge of Ariston.
Diodorus Siculus (<i>c.</i> <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 20), quoting Agatharcides (<span class="smcap">b.c.</span>
110), and the geographer Strabo (<i>c.</i> <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 24), quoting Artemidorus
(<span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 100), give an account of the information that is
preserved regarding Sinai. After describing the western<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
shore of the Red Sea with its countries and its inhabitants
who were Ichthyophagoi (fish-eaters), and Troglodytes (cave-dwellers)
or nomads, and the dangers which threatened
shipping from storms and sand-banks, Diodorus, in his
account, passed to the other side of the Gulf. Here
Ariston erected an altar at Neptunium or Posidium. “From
thence to the mouth of the Gulf, is a place along the sea-coast
of great esteem among the inhabitants for the profit it
yields them; it is called the Garden of Palm-trees (Phoenikon),
because they abound there, and are so very fruitful that they
yield sufficient both for pleasure and necessity. But the
whole country next adjoining is destitute of rivers and brooks,
and lying to the south is even burned up by the heat of the
sun; and therefore this fruitful tract that lies amongst dry
and barren regions (remote from tillage and improvement),
and yet affords such plenty of food and provision, is justly,
by the barbarians, dedicated to the gods. For there are in it
many fountains and running streams as cold as snow, by which
means the region from one side to the other is always green
and flourishing, and very sweet and pleasant to the view.
In this place there is an ancient altar of hard stone, with an
inscription in old and illegible characters; where a man
and a woman, that execute here the priest’s office during
their lives, have the charge of the grove and altar. They are
persons of quality and great men that abide here, and for
fear of the beasts, have their beds (they rest upon) in the
trees.”<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> In the corresponding account Strabo mentioned no
altar, but the man and woman who guarded the trees.<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a></p>

<p>The Phoenikon or palm grove of these writers, was sometimes
located at Raithou; perhaps the one at Ayun Musa
is meant.</p>

<p>Diodorus then mentioned the Island of the Sea-calves on
the coast of Arabia, and the promontory (<i>i.e.</i> Sinai) that shoots
out towards this island, describing this as “over against
Petra in Arabia and Palestine to which the Gerrhaens and
Mineans bring incense.” He then mentioned the Maraneans
and Garindaeans (names which recall Mara and Wadi Gharandel,
the Carandar of Pliny), who dwell along the coast,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
and related how the Maraneans were absent on their quinquennial
festival, sacrificing fattened camels to the gods of
the grove and fetching spring water, when the Garindaeans
killed those who were left behind and then murdered those
who returned and seized their country.</p>

<p>According to Diodorus (still quoting Ariston) there were
few harbours along the shore in the direction of the Aleanite
promontory where dwelt the Arabians called Nabateans,
who held not only the coast but large districts inland. The
Nabateans have a special interest for Sinai, since the numerous
rough rock-inscriptions along the wadis of the south, which
long puzzled the learned, are now generally attributed to them.</p>

<p>Josephus located Nabatea between Syria and Arabia
extending from the Euphrates to the Red Sea, and connected
the name Nabatean with Nebajoth, whose name stands first
in the confederacy of the Ishmaelite tribes (Gen. xxv. 13).<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a>
On the other hand Strabo, like Diodorus Siculus, located them
in north-western Arabia, extending as far south as Leukokome
on the Gulf of Arabia.<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a></p>

<p>The existence of Nabateans in districts that lay far apart
is explained by the recently discovered Annals of Assyria.
In the long list of peoples “Arameans all of them,” who were
raided by Sennacherib (<i>c.</i> <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 705), mention is made of the
Nabatu, of whom large numbers were carried off into Assyria.<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a>
Again, when Ashurbanipal (<span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 668-626) set out to conquer
Arabia, King Vaiteh of Arabia sought refuge with Nathan,
king of Nabat, “whose place is remote.” The Nabateans
were again raided, and numbers of them were transplanted.
“The road to Damascus I caused their feet to tread.”<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a>
The remote homes of the Nabateans was attested by Makrizi
(† 1441), who classed them with the Magi, the Indians and
the Chinese. These denied the Flood because it had never
penetrated to them, and traced their origin, not to Noah, but
to Kajumath.<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a></p>

<p>The efforts of the transplanted Nabateans to remain in
touch with their home sanctuaries, may have opened their
eyes to the possibilities of trade. In the fourth century<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
before Christ, they attracted the attention of the western world
by seizing Petra, the Ha-Sela of antiquity, which lay half-way
between the head of the Gulf of Akaba and the Dead Sea at
the point where the old gold and incense route from Arabia
to Damascus was crossed by the overland route from India
to Egypt. This appropriation gave the Nabateans the control
of the Eastern trade. In order to check their progress
Antigonus Cyclops, king of Syria and Palestine since <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 312,
sent Athenæus and an army against them. The army
reached Petra at the time when the Nabateans were absent
on a pilgrimage. They easily overcame the aged, the women
and children, and seized an enormous booty in spicery and
silver. But the returning Nabateans overtook and well nigh
destroyed the invading force. Another army was sent
under Demetrius to seize Petra, and chastise the Nabateans.
But these drew the enemy along desert tracks, and the invaders
achieved nothing.<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a></p>

<p>Henceforth the Nabateans acted as a recognised nation,
whose kings from about <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 200 held their own by the side of
the kings of Judæa. Of these kings Aretas I (<i>Arabic</i> Harith),
the contemporary of Antiochus Epiphanes (<span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 173-164),
received the fugitive Hasmoneans (2 Macc. v. 8); Malchos I
dwelt at Petra and struck a coinage; Aretas III was master
of Damascus and king of Cœle-Syria. Their control over the
trade-routes extended in many directions. Along the
Mediterranean on the north coast of Sinai they secured a
foothold far beyond the limit of Cœle-Syria almost as far as
the Tanitic mouth of the Nile. For excavations made at Qasr
Ghait or Ouait between Kantara and Katia led to the discovery
of a Nabatean sanctuary with a Nabatean inscription.<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a></p>

<p>As the Romans advanced their frontier, they were brought
into contact with the kings of Nabat. Malchos II in the year
<span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 47, supported the Romans under Cæsar, and entered into
an agreement with them. As a result, a Roman tax-collector
resided at Leukokome, the southernmost point of Nabat.
After the conquest of Egypt in <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 30, the Romans, their
imagination fired by the thought of the untold wealth of
Arabia, entered into an agreement with the Nabateans, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
sent eighty boats, with ten thousand men, including five
hundred Jews and a thousand Nabateans. These sailed from
Arsinoë around Sinai in <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 25 to invade and conquer Arabia.
It was in vain that Syllæus, the Roman tax-gatherer at
Leukokome, urged that the Arabians were rich in merchandise
only. The expedition landed, camels were chartered and the
Romans entered the country. But here they found a land
bare of food and water, and no one to contend with. The
expedition was a miserable failure, but Syllæus who tried
to prevent it, was accused of treachery and condemned to
death.<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a></p>

<p>The Nabateans had originally been content with pastoral
pursuits. For a time they became pirates and had little
skiffs, with which they despoiled all other merchants who
trafficked in their seas. Their obvious intention was to
protect the trade along their overland route which assumed
great proportions as we learn from the remarks of Strabo.</p>

<p>One reason of their success in this direction was their
extensive use of the camel as a means of transport. There
are many references in the Assyrian annals to the large number
of camels which were bred in Arabia. Ashurbanipal (<span class="smcap">b.c.</span>
668-626) says that after his conquest of Arabia, “camels
like sheep I distributed and caused to overflow to the people
of Assyria dwelling in my country. A camel for half a shekel,
in half shekels of silver, they were valued for at the gate.”<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a>
The Nabateans employed camels in such numbers that Strabo
spoke of their convoys of camels (καμηλέμποροι), which
moved between Petra and Leukokome in the land of Nabat,
with so many people and camels that they resembled armies.
The camels moved to and fro at certain periods of the year,
being timed by the arrival at Leukokome of the boats from
the East. In between they were driven to pasture in the
fruitful wadis which lay near the caravan routes. It was to
the men herding these camels that the wadis of southern
Sinai owed their inscriptions.</p>

<p>These inscriptions consist, for the most part, of a few words,
including a name or a greeting, which are roughly incised on
rock or boulder at about the height of a man above the valley
floor. Some are accompanied by signs or by the rough drawing
of animals or men, sometimes there are drawings and signs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
without writing. The animals are chiefly camels, gazelles or
cattle. There are some horsemen and some nondescript
animals. Among the signs that are used are the Egyptian
<i>ankh</i>, the Greek <i>alpha</i> and <i>omega</i>, and the Christian cross,
showing that a great variety of persons passed there. The
words are written without regularity, the animals and men
are drawn with poor skill. They are, for the most part, unattractive
scrawls, the interest of which lies in the information
which they indirectly convey.</p>

<p>The inscriptions in the wadis of southern Sinai were first
noted by the lady Etheria who visited the peninsula about
the year 450. A century later they attracted the attention
of Cosmas, whose second name, Indicopleustes, marked the
extent of his travels. Cosmas was in Sinai about the year
545, and in his <i>Christian Topography</i> wrote of the inscriptions,
which he attributed to Israelite industry.</p>

<p>“And when they had received the Law from God in writing
and had learnt letters for the first time, God made use of the
desert as a quiet school and permitted them for forty years
to carve out letters on stone. Wherefore, in that wilderness
of Mount Sinai one can see, at all their halting places, all the
stones that have been broken off from the mountains, inscribed
with Hebrew letters, as I myself can testify, having travelled
in those places. Certain Jews too, who had read these inscriptions,
informed me of their purpose which was as follows:
the departure of so and so of such and such a tribe, in such
and such a year, in such and such a month,&mdash;just as with ourselves,
there are travellers who scribble their names in the
inns in which they lodge.&mdash;And the Israelites, who had newly
acquired the art of writing, continually practised it, and filled
a great multitude of stones with writing, so that all those
places are full of Hebrew inscriptions, which, as I think, have
been preserved to this day for the sake of unbelievers. Anyone
who wishes, can go to these places, and see for himself, or
at least can enquire of others, about the matter, when he will
learn that it is the truth which we have spoken.&mdash;When the
Hebrews therefore had been at the first instructed by God,
and had received a knowledge of letters through those tables
of stone, and had learned them for forty years in the wilderness,
they communicated them to the Phœnicians at that time
when first Cadmus was king of the Tyrians, from whom the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
Greeks received them, and then in turn the other nations
of the world.”<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a></p>

<p>After the time of Cosmas we hear no more of the inscriptions,
till the seventeenth century when they attracted the attention
of Pietro della Valle about the year 1618.<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> In the eighteenth
century copies were brought home of some of them which
attracted further attention. In 1762 Niebuhr went to Sinai
with the intention of visiting the Gebel Mukattab, or mountain
of writing. He was taken, instead, by his sheykh to the inscribed
ruins of Serabit. Some of the rough Sinaitic inscriptions
appeared in the <i>Transactions of the Royal Society of Literature</i>
in 1832; others were incorporated by Lepsius in his work on
Sinai. They were first claimed for the Nabateans by Lévy
in 1860.<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> Prof. Palmer of the Ordnance Survey collected
over 3000 between 1868-70, and endorsed the view that they
were the work of traders and carriers. Prof. Euting recently
published over 300 in facsimile and collected similar inscriptions
along the wadis west of Petra between Damascus and Palmyra,
and elsewhere.<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> It is said to be habitual in Arabia to scrawl
tribal marks on walls and rocks in order to show the rights
of the tribe, a name and a greeting being frequently added
as a notice to kinsmen and friends passing that way. These
casual marks and inscriptions have recently gained a new
interest, for the light which they throw on the development
of the Arabic script.</p>

<p>Most of the inscriptions along the wadis of Sinai are in
Aramaic or other Semitic script, a few are in Greek, a few are
in Kufic. The larger number are pagan, and their character is
indicated by such as the following, “Remember Zailu, son
of Wailu, son of Bitasu” (no. 11).<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> “Think of Sambu, son
of Nasaigu” (<i>Ibid.</i>, no. 120). Many names are those of the
Bible, including Jacob (no. 510) and Moses (no. 337). How the
sight of these names must have rejoiced the heart of Cosmas!
Others include names that are current in Arabia at the
present day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>In Greek script stand the words “Be mindful (μνησθῇ) of
Chalios the son of Zaidu” (no. 253). One inscription consists
of an Egyptian <i>ankh</i> with the <i>alpha</i> and <i>omega</i> on either side,
and the Greek words <i>Kyrie eleison</i>, with the figure of an animal
that may be intended for a camel (no. 380). Again, in Greek
stand the words “An evil race! I, Lupus, a soldier, wrote
this with my hand” (no. 613). Another inscription consists
of a cross with the words “Amen, one God, our Saviour”
(no. 581).</p>

<p>A definite date is conveyed by the following: “Blessed
be Wailu, son of Sad Allahi, this is the 85th year of the eparchy”
(no. 463). And again, “Think of Aallahi, son of Iali, in the
year 106, which is that of the three emperors” (no. 451).
In the year <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 105 Trajan attacked the Nabateans in Petra,
which he conquered, and he established the Roman headquarters
at Bosra, from which the so-called era of Bosra was
dated. The first of the inscriptions which mentioned the
85th year, therefore indicated <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 189; the second inscription,
which mentioned the 106th year, indicated <i>a.d.</i> 211,
the year in which the three emperors Septimus Severus,
Caracalla and Geta succeeded one another.</p>

<p>Some authorities also make the Nabateans responsible for
the circular huts built of stone, the so-called Nawamis, groups
of which are found in the Wadi Wutah, the Wadi Sigilliyeh,
and elsewhere. About the year 450 Etheria saw some on
her way to the Mount of the Law, and looked upon them as
houses built by the Israelites. The huts served at different
times as store-houses, places of burial, and hermitages;
their origin is quite uncertain. Besides these huts, rectangular
huts were noticed in the Wadi Aleyat, the Wadi Nasb, and
elsewhere. These also cannot, at present, be claimed for any
age.</p>

<p>The introduction of the camel to the wadis of Sinai dealt
one more blow at the vegetation of the peninsula. For the
camel is to all purposes a huge goat, and, like the goat, is a
most destructive animal. His introduction was necessarily
followed by the loss of verdure which resulted in loosening
of the soil and spread of the desert. In Egypt the introduction
of the camel during Roman times depleted the flora
and altered the fauna. Gazelles and antelopes sought pasture
elsewhere, and the crocodile that lay in wait for them when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
they came to water, altogether disappeared. In Sinai the
effects were equally marked. Gazelles, still numerous in
early Christian times, are found now in the remoter wadis
only, and the depletion of the soil which began with the destruction
of trees for purposes of smelting and charcoal-burning,
was carried one stage further by the havoc wrought among
the lower growth by the camel.</p>

<p>The conquest of Petra by Trajan in the year 105 set a term
to the existence of the kings of Nabat. The greater part of
their domain was now incorporated in the Roman province
of Arabia, which was firmly and wisely administered by the
prefect Aulus Cornelius Palma, who left Nabatean religious
cults untouched. The annexation of Damascus followed,
through which the control of the trade of the East altogether
passed under the Romans.</p>

<p>The frontier line between Egypt and Asia during the
period of Roman rule began at Raphia, modern Rafa, and ran
in a westerly direction, then turning sharply south towards
Arsinoë near the present Suez. The coastal province was
called Augustamnica Prima according to Ammianus Marcellinus.
It included a number of cities which, by virtue of
being situated in a province belonging to Egypt, were later
included in the patriarchate of Alexandria.</p>

<p>The first of these cities on the road from Syria was El Arish,
situated near the Wadi el Arish, the river or “stream of
Egypt” of the Bible (Isa. xxvii. 12). El Arish was accounted
a very ancient city by the Arabs. Its land was cultivated
soon after the Deluge and was called the Gate to Paradise.
Abraham passed here. Makrizi († 1441) relates a tradition
regarding the building of reed huts there, which recalls an
incident preserved by Diodorus Siculus (<i>c.</i> <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 20), the origin
of which may be sought in the wish to explain the later name
of the city which was Rhinocorura or Rhinocolura. According
to Diodorus, King Actisanes of Egypt, possibly Hor-em-heb
(XVIII 14), having conquered Egypt, collected all who were
suspected of thieving, and after their judicial conviction, caused
their noses to be cut off, and sent them to colonise a city built
for them at the extremity of the desert. Here, being destitute
of means of subsistence, they resorted to the device of splitting
reeds, which they wove into nets and stretched out along the
sea shore to catch quails. The incident of the noses (quasi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
ῥῖνος κόλουροι = curti, al. ρ. κείρασθαι), determined the name of
the place.<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> Its Egyptian name was probably Zaru (<a href="#i145">Fig. 18</a>).</p>

<p>The city gained in importance during Roman times.
Strabo called it a city of Phœnicia, close to Egypt, and an
emporium of Indian and Arabic merchandise, which was
discharged at Leukokome and conveyed via Petra to Rhinocorura,
where it was dispersed.<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> The city is now partly enclosed
by walls of considerable thickness, and lies half a mile from the
coast on the edge of the desert. According to the travellers,
Irby and Mangles, it contains some notable Roman remains.
From this period probably date the marble columns, later
appropriated to the churches which were eventually transported
to Cairo.</p>

<p>West of Rhinocorura lay Ostracine, the site of which is
nowadays surrounded by marshland which is flooded at
certain times of the year. The city was formerly fed by a
canal that brought water from the Tanitic branch of the Nile.
The strategic importance of Ostracine attracted the attention
of the emperor Vespasian. For the road coming from Syria
divided at Ostracine. One branch led north of the Serbonian
bog, <i>via</i> Casium, Gerra and Pelusium to Alexandria; another
passing south of the bog, was the old military road to Memphis
with stations at Katia and Kantara. A third road led from
Ostracine to Arsinoë (near the present Suez), which Pliny
described as “mountainous and destitute of water” (asperum
montibus et inops aquarum).<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a></p>

<p>Ostracine has recently been excavated by Clédat. It
consisted of two parts, an inland part with a fortress and a
church which have been excavated, and a maritime port,
Ostracine Majumas, where Roman remains were found, including
mosaics and sculpture, now transferred to the museum
at Ishmailia. The buildings were not constructed of brick,
but of stone, which points to a certain wealth. Here also
there were the remains of a church. The name Ostracine
signifies shell, a meaning reproduced in the Arabic El Flousiyeh
the name of the village that now occupies the site of the
inland part of the town.</p>

<p>West of Ostracine lay the Serbonian bog which stood out
in men’s minds as the scene of the disaster which befell the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>invading Persian forces in the year <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 350. On the northern
side of the bog, beyond the break in the narrow strip of land
confining it, lay Casium, which had a hill with a temple dedicated
to Zeus Casius or Jupiter Ammon. On the flank of this
hill a tumulus marked the place where the beheaded body of
Pompey the Great was buried. Pompey was murdered when
he landed on the coast after his defeat at Pharsalia; and
Hadrian, at a later date, erected a monument to his memory
of which remains were found near Pelusium.</p>

<p>West of Casium lay Gerra, from Greek <i>gerrhon</i>, a shield,
a name which corresponds in meaning with Shur, Hebrew
for wall, in the Bible. “Shur that is before Egypt as thou
goest toward Assyria” (Gen. xxv. 18). Brugsch identified it
as the Egyptian Aneb.<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a></p>

<p>Gerra was known also as the camp of Chabrias, the Athenian
general, who entered the service of the Pharaoh Nectanebo
(XXX 1, <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 378-61), and later commanded the forces of
his successor Zeher (XXX 2), in opposing the Persian invasion
of Egypt. The cities along the Mediterranean coast were
at the distance of a Roman day’s march, about 14 miles,
from each other. Titus on his march from Egypt for the
conquest of Jerusalem, pitched his camp in succession near
the temple of the Casian Jupiter, at Ostracine, at Rhinocorura
and at Raphia, as recorded by Josephus (<i>Wars</i>, IV. 11, 5).
On the <i>Table Peutinger</i>, the Roman road map of the second
century, land and water are roughly marked with the stations
along the roads of communication. On this Table along the
shore of the Mediterranean we note <i>Gerra</i> (?) miles to <i>Casium</i>,
26 miles to <i>Ostracine</i>, 24 miles to <i>Rhinocorura</i>, 28 miles to
<i>Raphia</i>.</p>

<p class="pch">THE HERMITS IN SINAI</p>

<p class="drop-cap04">A NEW era in the history of Sinai began with the advent of
the Christian hermit. The desert has ever been the
home of liberty. The desire to follow the New Way, coupled
with the need of escaping the Roman governor, drove many
Christians into the wilderness, where, remote from the claims
and the unrest of citizen life, they embraced life in a form
which meant reducing physical needs to a minimum.</p>

<p>This life in itself was no new departure. Again and again
in the course of history, a recoil from civilisation led men
to seek enlightenment in remoteness, simplicity and solitude.
Elijah the Tishbite, with rough mantle and flowing locks;
John the Baptist, who lived on locusts and wild honey;
the Essenes in Palestine, and the Therapeutæ near Alexandria,
were one and all actuated by the belief that a higher life is
possible here below, provided that the amenities and the comforts
of this world count as nothing.</p>

<p>The hermits who came to dwell in Sinai, settled in the
mountains of the south where many natural springs rendered
possible the cultivation of vegetables and fruit, their staple
articles of diet. Here they were outside the sphere of Roman
influence. The extent of this influence can be gauged by the
<i>Table Peutinger</i>.</p>

<p>On this Table two roads, the one coming from Syria, the
other from Egypt, lead to <i>Pharan</i> in Sinai proper. The road
from Egypt passed <i>Arsinoë</i>, <i>Clesma</i>, <i>Lacus Mar</i>, and a station,
the name of which is obliterated, but which Weill reads as
Medeia. From this it was 80 miles to Pharan. The road
from Syria, starting from Jerusalem, passed <i>Oboda</i>, <i>Lyssa</i>,
<i>Cypsana</i>, <i>Rasa</i>, <i>Ad Dianam</i> (later Ghadiana), i.e. <i>Aila</i>, from
where it was 60 miles to <i>Pharan</i>. Pharan was no doubt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
the κωμὴ, <i>i.e.</i> village Pharan of Ptolemy, the later seat of the
episcopate. This was, therefore, the southernmost point of
Roman administration in the peninsula. It was beyond this,
among the mountains of the south and on the coast near
Tur, that the hermits settled by preference.</p>

<p>The inhabitants of the peninsula at this period were called
Ishmaelites or Saracens. The origin of the word Saracen has
been much discussed. Ptolemy, the geographer, located
Sarakene on the borders of Egypt, and the Sarakeni east of
the Gulf of Akaba.<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> According to Eucherius († <i>c.</i> 449), the
Arabs and the Agarenes in his time were called Saracens.<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a>
But the historian Sozomenus († 443) held that the Ishmaelites
deliberately called themselves Saracens in allusion to Sarah,
because they resented the association with Hagar.<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> Sprenger
connected the word with <i>saraka</i>, Arabic for robber; the
present view is that it signifies easterner.</p>

<p>The Saracens are mentioned in a letter which Dionysius,
bishop of Alexandria, wrote about the year 250, in which he
mentioned that the Christians fled to the desert to escape
persecution. “Many were seized in the Arabian mountains
by the heathen Saracens and carried off into captivity.”<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a>
By the Arabian mountain he probably meant the hills between
the Nile valley and the Red Sea, but he may be referring to
Sinai.</p>

<p>An early hermit of Sinai was St. Onophrius, whom Nectarius,
in his <i>Epitome of Holy History</i>, numbered among the
founders of ascetic life.<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> Onophrius dwelt in a grotto in the
Wadi Leyan, south of the Gebel Musa, which was visited
during the Middle Ages by pilgrims and is still pointed out to
travellers.<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a></p>

<p>Paphnutius († <i>c.</i> 390), a monk of Egypt, came across
Onophrius on his wanderings and wrote a life of him. Onophrius
told him that he had been in the desert seventy years.
Originally he dwelt in the Thebaid with about a hundred
monks, but hearing of Elijah and John the Baptist, he decided<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
that it was more meritorious to dwell alone in the desert,
so he wandered away, led by an angel, and met a hermit
who urged him to go five days further where he reached
“Calidiomea” (perhaps a corruption of <i>calybem</i>, a hut),
near which stood a palm tree where he remained. He suffered
from hunger and thirst, from cold and heat, and lived on dates,
his clothes gradually dropping from him. He took Paphnutius
into his hut, and they were conversing together when
a sudden pallor overspread his countenance, and he intimated
that Paphnutius would bury him. He died there and then,
and Paphnutius tore a piece off his own cloak, in which he
wrapped him and laid him in a crevice in the rock.<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a></p>

<p>Onophrius was perhaps the unnamed hermit who was
visited by a monk of Raithou, “where stood seventy palm
trees in the place which Moses reached with the people when
he came out of Egypt.” This monk described how, on his
wanderings, he came to a cell in which he found a dead monk
whose body dropped to dust when he touched it. In another
place he came upon a hermit who had lived in an ascetic
community at Heroöpolis, but he associated with a professed
nun, and yielded to temptation, whereupon he fled into the
distant desert where, as time went on, his hair grew and his
clothes dropped from him.<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a></p>

<p>Of similar appearance was the hermit whom Postumianus
was bent on seeing when he went from Italy into Sinai some
time before 400. In the <i>Dialogues</i> of Severus the words are
put into his lips: “I saw the Red Sea and I climbed the
height of Mount Sinai (jugum Sina Montis), the summit of
which almost touches heaven and cannot be reached by human
effort. A hermit was said to live somewhere in its recesses,
and I sought long and much to see him, but was unable to do
so. He had been removed from human fellowship for nearly
fifty years and wore no clothes, but was covered with bristles
growing on his body, but of divine gift he knew not of his
nakedness.”<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a></p>

<p>Another hermit who was drawn to Sinai was Silvanus,
a native of Palestine, “to whom on account of his great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
virtue, an angel was wont to minister. He lived in Sinai and
afterwards founded, at Gerari (? Gerra), in the wadi, a very
extensive and noted cœnobium for many good men, over which
the excellent Zacharias, afterwards presided.”<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> Like other
hermits, Silvanus shared his cell with a youthful disciple,
and cultivated a garden that was surrounded by a wall and
served by a water conduit. Various anecdotes told of him
bear witness to his good sense and humility.</p>

<p>“A certain brother once came to Sinai where he found the
brethren hard at work and he said to them, Labour not for the
meat that perishes. Silvanus, who overheard the remark,
directed his disciple Zacharias to give him a book and lead him
to an empty cell. When the ninth hour came, the brother looked
towards the entrance expecting to be called to a meal, but
no one came, so he went to Silvanus and said, Father, do not
the brethren eat to-day? Silvanus replied, Oh yes, they have
eaten. Then why was I not called? Because, said Silvanus,
thou art a spiritual man who needs no such food. We
others, being carnal, must eat, and therefore we work. Thou
hast in truth chosen the better part, and art able to study
all day requiring nothing. On hearing this, the brother
saw that he was at fault, and said, Father, forgive me. Silvanus
replied, Surely Martha is necessary to Mary, it was due
to her that Mary was able to pray. Silvanus himself worked
with his hands, chiefly at basket-making, so as to earn his
living and not depend on alms.”</p>

<p>The baskets, we gather from other remarks, were used to
pack dates for export. Like other hermits, Silvanus had
visions. One day he sat for a long time without speaking
and then burst into tears. It was, he said, because he saw
men of his own kind going to hell, while many secular
persons went to heaven. Among the sayings attributed to
him was this one, “Woe unto him who has more renown than
merit.”<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a></p>

<p>Other early hermits were Gala̭ction and his wife Episteme,
whose experiences were noted in the <i>Menology</i> of Basileus,<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a>
and were worked up into a longer account by Simeon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
Metaphrastes. They were from Emesa and took ten days to
reach the height called Pouplios (? <i>Rubus</i>, the Bush), near
Mount Sinai (τὸ Σινᾶ ὄρος), where they found ten hermits who
were joined by Gala̭ction. Episteme dwelt at some distance
with four virgins. But the Roman governor (Ursus) sent
for Gala̭ction. Episteme, apprised by a dream, came forward
to die for him. Both endured the penalty of death, and
Eutolmios, at one time their slave, recovered and brought back
their bodies.<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a></p>

<p>The settlement where Episteme dwelt was afterwards
allotted to the slaves who were brought into Sinai and appointed
to serve the convent by the emperor Justinian († 563). The
settlement lay on a slope north-east of the convent facing
the valley, and was pointed out to Bishop Pococke in the year
1734.<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> The existence here of a settlement of women, and
the value which was set on the bodies of the hermits, are worth
noting in connection with the finding of the body of St. Katherine
of Alexandria, to which we shall return later.</p>

<p>Other saints who were connected with Sinai were the well-known
Cosmas and Damianus, Arab doctors who taught
Christianity. There are no traditions regarding their coming
into Sinai, but their names were attached to a hermitage,
now dilapidated, which stood at Tholas, in the Wadi Tla’ah,
and was dedicated to them.</p>

<p>It was customary at the time for the hermits to wander
from place to place. Among the famous hermits who visited
Sinai was Julian Sabbas († 363), who left his cell near Osrhoene
(Edessa), and, with a few devoted followers, sought the remoteness
of Sinai where he remained some time. On reaching
the desired height (τὸ ποθούμενον ὄρος), he built a church
and set up an altar on the stone on which Moses, prince of
prophets, rested. Theodoret (<i>c.</i> 450), who related this, stated
that the altar remained in his day.<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> Antoninus Martyr
(<i>c.</i> 530) noted the existence of an oratory above Pharan,
with its altar on the stones which supported Moses when he
prayed.<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> The plan and ruins of an oratory are figured in the
Ordnance Survey (pl. X), which probably mark this spot.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
Its erection helped to locate the struggle of Moses and the
Amalekites in this valley, which, according to other views,
took place further south.</p>

<p>The hermits at this period occupied caverns and huts, an
older man, called <i>abbas</i>, <i>i.e.</i> father, usually dwelling with a
younger disciple. But as time wore on the cells were more
and more grouped around a centre where the hermits assembled
once a week for religious service. These centres or churches
sometimes consisted of a square tower built of stone, its
entrance raised above the ground, and in these the hermits
sought refuge in times of danger. One such tower or church
stood near Raithou, and formed part of the later convent of
St. John; another, the Arbaïn, now in ruins, stood in the Wadi
Layan, near the grotto of Onophrius; a third was near the
Bush, and was included in the present convent. Tradition
claimed that the tower near the Bush, was built by Helena, the
mother of the emperor Constantine, and was dedicated to the
Theotokos in order to commemorate the spot where the Lord
appeared to Moses in the Burning Bush.<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> The tower was
pointed out to Burckhardt, and was described by him as of
older construction than the convent.<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> The pilgrimage of
Helena to the East in the year 326 is well authenticated, but
there is no contemporary reference to her entering Sinai.
If there were, it would be the earliest association of the site
of the convent with the coming of Moses.</p>

<p>We first hear of bishops established in cities of Sinai
in connection with religious discussions and difficulties. At
the beginning of the fourth century Arius raised doubts regarding
the fundamental truth of the Divine Sonship, and a
synod of three hundred and ninety bishops met at Nicæa
in the year 325 to discuss the question. Among those who
set their signature to the declaration of faith which rejected
the claims of Arius was Peter, bishop of Ahila, <i>i.e.</i> Aila,
a city which, by virtue of its situation was included in the
province of Palestine.<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a></p>

<p>As a sequel to these discussions a Council was held in the
church of St. Thekla at Seleucia in September of the year 359
by order of the emperor Constantius, at which there were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
present a hundred and sixty bishops, about two-thirds of
whom were semi-Arians. Theoctistes, bishop of Ostracine, was
among them.<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> He was therefore deposed by Athanasius,
patriarch of Alexandria († 371), who appointed, in his stead,
Serapion.<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> But the representatives of the neighbouring see
of Rhinocorura firmly held by Athanasius, and Sozomenus
(† 443), after praising the hermits of Nitria, wrote of Rhinocorura,
“celebrated at this period for its holy men, who were
not from abroad, but natives of the place. Among the most
eminent philosophers were Melas, who then administered the
church in the country; Dionysius, who presided over a
monastery to the north of the city; and Solon, the brother
and successor of Melas in the bishopric.” When, owing to
a decision of Valens (<i>c.</i> <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 364), there was a reaction in
favour of Arius, officers appeared at Rhinocorura who were
charged with orders to eject those opposed to Arianism. Melas,
who did the lowliest work, offered a meal to the officers, waiting
on them himself, and declared his willingness to go into exile.
His brother Solon gave up commerce in order to embrace
the monastic life. “The church of Rhinocorura having been
thus from the beginning under the guidance of exemplary
bishops, never afterwards swerved from their precepts and
produced good men. The clergy of this church dwell in one
house, sit at the same table, and have everything in common.”<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a>
Among these bishops was Polybius, a disciple of Epiphanius,
bishop of Salamis in Cyprus († 403), who wrote a supplement
to the <i>Life of Epiphanius</i>.</p>

<p>The religious difficulties, combined with the general unrest
which followed the conjoint rule of the imperial brothers,
Valentinian and Valens (364-367), are reflected in the account
told by the Egyptian monk Ammonius of what happened at the
time when he was on a visit to Sinai with the hermits at the
Bush. The account which he wrote in Coptic is preserved
in Greek, in Syriac, and in Latin.<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> It is a composition of
considerable merit, to which the condensed account, which
follows, can do but scant justice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>“It occurred to me,” wrote Ammonius, “as I sat in my
little cell near Alexandria at the place called Canopus, that
I could go a journey and thus escape the persecutions (by the
Arians) of the faithful, who included our holy bishop Peter
(II, 372-380), who was obliged to go into hiding, first at one
place and then at another, and was thereby hindered from
ministering to his flock. I was, moreover, fired by the desire
to see the memorable places, including the Holy Sepulchre,
the place of the Resurrection, and others that were associated
with our Lord Jesus Christ. After worshipping at these
places, I decided to seek the holy mountain called Sinai,
going the desert journey together with others who were bent
on the same purpose, and I journeyed thither (from Jerusalem)
with the help of God in eighteen days. And when I had
prayed I remained with the holy fathers in order to visit their
several cells to the profit of my soul.”</p>

<p>A description follows of the occupations of the hermits,
their solitary life on week-days, and their gatherings in church
on Sundays. “Their aspect was that of angels, for they
were pallid and, so to say, incorporeal, owing to their abstaining
from wine, oil, bread, and other food that tends to
luxury, living on dates only, just enough to keep themselves
alive.”</p>

<p>“A few days later,” Ammonius continued, “Saracens,
whose sheykh (or king) had died, fell upon the fathers in their
cells and slew them, so that I, together with the superior
Doulas and others sought refuge in the tower, while the
barbarians slew all the hermits who were in Thrambe (Syriac,
Gethrabbi),<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> Choreb (Horeb), Kedar (Codar), and other
places. They would have dealt the same with us, but a great
fire appeared on the mountain which scared them so they fled,
leaving behind their women, children and camels. We who
saw this from the tower, gave thanks to God, and then sallied
forth to the other settlements. We found 38 hermits who
were dead. Twelve belonged to Thrambe, including Isaiah
and Sabbas who were badly hurt. Isaiah died while Sabbas
lamented that he was not in the company of the saints.
But he died four days later (on the last day of the year).”</p>

<p>They were lamenting his death when an Ishmaelite brought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
the news that the fathers who dwelt at Elim (Raithou) had
been raided also. Raithou is described as “a level plain,
situated at a distance of about twelve miles, with mountains
to the east like a wall, which those only could cross who were
familiar with the country. To the west was the Red Sea,
which extended to the ocean.” The words correctly describe
the district about Tur.</p>

<p>The settlement here was attacked by the Blemmyes, a
nomad race of Nubia, of whom we now hear in Sinai for the
first time. Psoes, a fugitive hermit, who arrived in the wake
of the Ishmaelite, gave Ammonius particulars regarding the
hermits at Raithou, and their message. He had lived 20
years at Raithou himself, he said; others had lived there
40, 50, and 60 years. There was Abba Moses of Pharan, who
had the power of exorcising demons, and who had cured
Obedianus, a sheykh of the Ishmaelites, which led to many
conversions. There was also Sabbas, of whom Psoes was a
disciple, but the way of living of Sabbas was so hard that
Psoes left him. Again, there was Joseph from Aila, who built
himself a cell with his own hands at a distance of two miles
from the springs.</p>

<p>Forty-three hermits dwelt near Raithou, to which place
the news was brought that the Blemmyes had seized an
Egyptian boat which was bound for Clysma, and were coming
across the sea. The men of Raithou at once collected their
camels, their women and children, while the hermits sought
refuge in the church. The barbarians spent the night on the
shore, and then bound the sailors to the boat which they
left in charge of one of themselves, and came across the
mountain to the springs where they were met by the men of
Raithou. But the invaders were the more skilful archers,
and killed 140 men, the rest fled. Then they seized the
women and children, and rushed to the tower or church,
expecting to find treasures, and went round it screaming and
uttering threats in a barbarous language while the hermits
inside prayed and lamented.</p>

<p>Paul of Petra, who was the superior of the settlement,
uttered words which were full of dignity, and concluded with
saying: “O athletes of God, do not regret this good conflict;
let not your souls be faint, and do nothing unworthy of your
cowl, but be clothed with strength and joy and manliness,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
that you may endure with a pure heart, and may God receive
you into His kingdom.”</p>

<p>In the meantime the barbarians, encountering no resistance,
heaped tree-trunks against the wall from outside, broke
open the door of the church, and rushed in, sword in hand.
They seized Jeremiah, who was sitting on the door-sill, and
commanded him through one who acted as interpreter, to
point out the superior. When he refused, they bound him
hand and foot, and tearing off his clothes, used him for a target.
“He was the first to gain the crown” (of martyrdom). Then
the superior Paul came forward declaring his identity, and
they bade him reveal his treasures. In his usual gentle voice
he replied: “Forsooth, children, I own nothing but this old
hair-cloth garment that I am wearing.” And he held it out,
displaying it. But the barbarians hurled stones at him,
shouting: “Out with your treasures,” and, after ill-using
him, cleft his head in twain with a sword.&mdash;“Then I, miserable
sinner,” continued Psoes, “seeing the slaughter and the blood
and the viscera on the ground, bethought me of a hiding
place. A heap of palm branches lay in the left-hand corner
of the church. Unnoticed by the barbarians, I ran to it,
saying to myself, If they find me, they can but kill me, which
they are sure to do, if I do not hide.”</p>

<p>From his hiding place he saw the barbarians cut down the
hermits who were in church. He saw them seize the youth
Sergius, whom they would have dragged away with them,
but he snatched a sword from a barbarian and hit him across
the shoulder, whereupon he was cut down himself. The
barbarians after killing the hermits, searched for treasures
not knowing that the saints own nothing here on earth, their
hope being of the world to come. Finally they rushed off
intending to embark. But the man who was left in charge
of the boat, being a Christian, had cut the rope, so that the
boat ran ashore and foundered; he himself escaped to the
mountain. The barbarians, who were at a loss what to do,
murdered the women and children, and then lit a fire and
cut down and burnt nearly all the palm trees of the place.</p>

<p>In the meantime the Ishmaelites from Pharan, some six
hundred in number and all of them expert archers, drew near
at dawn and attacked the barbarians, who, seeing no chance
of escape, met them bravely and perished, to a man. Of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
the men of Pharan eighty-four were killed, others were
wounded. The hermits were all dead except Andrew, who
was wounded and recovered, Domnus, who died of his wounds,
and Psoes, who was left to tell the tale. The men of Pharan
left the dead enemies to the beasts of the earth and the fowls
of the air. They buried their own dead at the foot of the
mountain above the springs, and made a great wailing. Then,
led by the sheykh Obedianus, they brought costly garments,
in which, with the help of Psoes and Andrew they buried the
saints. Psoes himself then left Raithou, which was deserted,
for the Bush, where he begged to be allowed to stay with
Doulas, a request which was readily granted. The account
concludes with saying that Ammonius wrote all this down after
his return to Memphis, and the words are added in one MS.,
“I, presbyter John, found this account written in Coptic in
the cell of a hermit near Naukratis, and, knowing Coptic, I
translated it into Greek.”</p>

<p class="p2">The attacks made on the hermits were part of a wider
movement. History relates that Mavia (or Mania), the widow
of the phylarch or king of the Saracens, collected her forces
and led them in person against Palestine and Egypt. The
Romans, because they had to do with a woman, expected
to quell the disturbance without difficulty. But the advantage
was on her side, and the expedition was celebrated in song
among the Saracens. Mavia proffered peace to the Romans
on condition that Moses, a converted Saracen, should be
consecrated bishop of Pharan, and Moses went to Alexandria
under a military escort. But here a new difficulty arose.
The patriarch Peter II (372-380), the same to whom Ammonius
referred, was still absent. The Arian prelate Lucius (<i>c.</i> <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>
378) occupied his see, and Moses refused to be ordained by
him. The story was told by Sozomenus († 443), and by
Socrates († <i>c.</i> 478), both of whom lived soon after the event.</p>

<p>“I account myself indeed unworthy of the sacred office,”
Moses said, “but if the exigencies of the state require my
bearing it, it shall not be by Lucius laying his hand on me,
for it has been filled with blood.” When Lucius told him that
it was his duty to learn from him the principles of religion
and not to utter reproachful language, Moses replied, “Matters
of faith are not now in question: but your infamous practices<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
against the brethren sufficiently prove that your doctrines
are not Christian. For a Christian is not a striker, reviles
not, does not fight, for it becomes not a servant of God to
fight. But your deeds cry out against you by those who
have been sent into exile, who have been delivered up to the
flames. These things which our own eyes have beheld are
far more convincing than what we receive from the report of
another.” As Moses expressed these and like sentiments,
his friends took him to the mountain, that he might receive
ordination from the bishops who lived in exile there. Moses
having been consecrated, the Saracen war was terminated,
and so scrupulously did Mavia observe the peace thus entered
into with the Romans that she gave her daughter in marriage
to Victor the commander-in-chief of the Roman army. Such
were the transactions in relation to the Saracens.”<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a></p>

<p>The fame of Moses continued. In the <i>Itinerary of Willibald</i>
(<i>c.</i> 750) we read that, after his return from Palestine, he
was received by Pope Hadrian in Rome at a time when St.
Boniface was asking for help on his mission to evangelise the
Germans. The Pope, in his desire to persuade Willibald to
undertake the task, referred to Moses the hermit, famous for innumerable
miracles in the desert, “who was torn away from
the solitary life he was leading at the request of Queen Mania
to the Roman emperor, and placed as bishop over the nation
of the Saracens, and in a short time he won to Christ that most
fierce nation, and clothed them in the fleece of lambs.”<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a>
The name of Moses was inscribed in the Roman Martyrology
on Feb. 27. “In Egypt the feast of Moses, a venerable
bishop, who at first lived a solitary life in the desert, and then,
at the request of Mauvia, queen of the Saracens, being made
bishop, converted that most ferocious nation in great part to
the faith, and made glorious by his merits rested in peace.”<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a></p>

<p>Moses was followed in the see of Pharan by Natyr, a
disciple of Silvanus, who was a strict ascetic.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XI</h2>

<p class="pch">THE WRITINGS OF THE HERMITS</p>

<p class="drop-cap04">THE writings of the hermits from the fifth century onwards
throw light on the aspirations and the attitude
of mind of these men of the desert, to whom the interests of
ordinary mankind were as nothing.</p>

<p>Foremost among these writings are those of Nilus, a man of
learning who, after occupying a high position at Constantinople,
visited the hermits, with whom he remained. His
<i>Narrationes</i> contain valuable information on heathen sacrifice
at the time.<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a></p>

<p>About the year 420 Nilus decided to separate from his
wife in order to visit the “Bush at the foot of the holy mountain
on which God conferred with the people,” taking his youthful
son with him. The barbarians, he tells us, dwelt from Arabia
to Egypt, from the Red Sea to the Jordan, ever ready to
draw the sword, hunting wild beasts, attacking travellers,
and making use of their camel-dromedaries for sacrifices which
they devoured with dog-like voracity. They had no regard
for God, but adored the Morning Star (Lucifer, ἄστρον
πρωϊνόν), to which they sacrificed the best product of the
chase, or boys of comely appearance, on an altar of rough
stones. Failing these, they took a fattened white camel
without blemish which they made to kneel. They encircled
it three times to the sound of chanting, whereupon the sheykh
who acted as leader, made a thrust at the beast’s neck, and all
of them hastily drank of the blood that gushed forth.</p>

<p>The whole band then fell upon the victim, and each person
hacked off and devoured a piece of the beast’s flesh and skin.
It was the rule of the rite that the whole victim with body,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
bones, blood and entrails, was done away with before the
rays of the sun appeared above the horizon (p. 613).</p>

<p>In contrast to this life was that of the hermits who dwelt
in huts and rock shelters within call of one another, removed
from the claims of the tax-gatherer, and emulating Moses and
Elijah in their fasting and humility, some cultivating corn
for bread, while others lived on vegetables and green meat,
coming together once a week on a Sunday. Nilus was among
them, having come down from the holy mountain with his
son on a visit to the hermits who dwelt near the Bush. They
happened to be in church, when a barbarian horde swept
down on them like a whirlwind, seized the food which they had
stored in their cells against the winter, and then called to the
hermits to come out of church, to strip and to stand according
to age. They cut down the priest Theodulos, and slew the
fathers Paulus and John, and then seized the young men,
bidding the older ones be gone. Many rushed up the mountain,
“which they generally avoid since God stood upon it and
conferred with the people” (p. 631). Nilus stood irresolute,
when his son Theodulos, whom the barbarians had seized,
signed to him to be gone. “O why,” he exclaimed, “did not
the ground open and swallow them like the sons of Korah?
Why had the miracles of Sinai ceased, and no thunder rolled,
no lightning flashed to scare them in their wickedness?”</p>

<p>When the barbarians had gone, Nilus helped to bury the
dead, and was presently joined by one of the youths who had
been carried off but escaped. He described how the barbarians
erected an altar, collected wood as a preparation for sacrificing
to Lucifer. This he was told by a fellow captive who understood
their language. The youths lay bound ready for sacrifice,
but he escaped by wriggling away on the ground like a snake.
His account filled Nilus with apprehension as to the fate of
his son, but in his misery he was upheld by the courage of a
woman of Pharan, whose son had actually been murdered.</p>

<p>As there had been other outrages, it was decided in the
council (βουλή) at Pharan to lodge a complaint with the
phylarch or king of the barbarians (p. 663). His relation to
the Roman empire was apparently that he must keep the peace
and safeguard those who passed through his territory, in
return for which he received a grant (<i>annonæ</i>). On much
the same basis, the sheykhs of Sinai under British rule, are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
responsible for keeping the peace, in return for which they
receive a grant in money which they must call for in person
at Suez.</p>

<p>Envoys were therefore despatched to the phylarch. They
carried bows and arrows, and a stone for striking fire, which
would enable them to live by killing and roasting game,
“for there is wood in abundance that serves as firewood,
since no one fells trees in the desert” (p. 663). During their
absence Nilus and others went the round of the neighbouring
settlements, where the hermits had been attacked. At
Bethrambe (or Thrambe) they buried Proclus; at Salael<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a>
they buried Hypatius; Macarius and Marcus they found dead
in the desert; Benjamin had been slain at Elim; Eusebius
was still alive at Tholas; in Adze they found Elias dead (p. 663).</p>

<p>The envoys on their return brought word that King
Ammanus was anxious to maintain his relations with the
empire, and was prepared to make good the losses which had
been incurred. He bade those who had claims to appear
before him. Nilus and others accordingly sallied forth. On
the eighth day Nilus, who was looking for water, actually
caught sight of the encamped Saracens; on the twelfth day
of journeying they reached the end of their journey, (which
may have been Petra). Here Nilus heard that his son was
alive and had been sold into slavery at Elusa. On the way
thither, he met a man who had actually seen him, and on
going into the church at Elusa, he found his son Theodulos,
who had been made doorkeeper of the church by the bishop
of the place. Theodulos told his father how he and others lay
bound on the ground all night near the altar with a sword,
a bason, a phial and incense beside them. But the barbarians
drank heavily at night and overslept themselves, and the sun
stood above the horizon when they awoke, so the occasion
for the sacrifice was forfeited. They therefore moved on to
Souka (perhaps a village, perhaps market, Arabic <i>suk</i>), from
where they sold Theodulos into slavery. Nilus and his son
now decided to settle permanently among the hermits looking
forward to a pleasant life. After being ordained by the
bishop of Elusa they returned to Sinai where they apparently
ended their days. Their memory there continues to be kept
to this day. Their bodies were raised together with those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
of others in the reign of the emperor Justinus Junior (565-578),
and were translated to the Church of the Holy Apostles at
Constantinople.<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a></p>

<p>In the course of the fifth century the dispute regarding
the dual nature of Christ entered a further stage when Nestorius,
who had been under the influence of Theodore of Mopsuestia,
and was promoted to the see of Constantinople, raised
objection to the term God-bearer, Θεοτόκος, as applied to the
Virgin. By doing so he raised a storm of dissent, the veneration
of the Virgin being widespread and deep-seated, partly
owing to having been engrafted on an earlier mother-cult.</p>

<p>Pope Celestinus (422-432) called upon Nestorius to recant,
but he refused, and a Church Council therefore met at Ephesus
in 431 to discuss the matter. Among the two hundred
bishops who declared against Nestorius were Hermogenes
of Rhinocorura, Abraham of Ostracine, and Lampetius of
Casium.<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> The outcome of the dispute was that Nestorius,
in the year 435, went into perpetual banishment. Hermogenes
of Rhinocorura was praised as a man of moderation
and humility, by Isidorus († 449), a monk and prolific letter-writer
of Pelusium.<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a></p>

<p>After the Council at Ephesus, Hermogenes went on a
mission to Rome with Lampetius of Casium, and was succeeded
in his bishopric by Zeno, who was succeeded by Alphius.<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a>
It was, perhaps, this Alphius who sided with Lampetius
(possibly the bishop of Casium) in the difficulty regarding
the vagrant ascetics called Massaliani or Euchites, men and
women, who gave themselves to prayer and lived by begging,
refusing to work. They were censured at the synod of
Ephesus,<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> and their condemnation henceforth acted as a
deterrent to the wanderings of hermits generally. In consequence
of his course of action Alphius was obliged to resign
his see. He was succeeded by Ptolemæus of Rhinocorura,
who acted in concert with Timothy, patriarch of Alexandria.</p>

<p>A further difficulty was created when the Church Council<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
met at Chalcedon under the auspices of the empress Pulcheria
and her husband Marcian, and in 451 laid down articles
as to the nature of Christ which remain to this day the
standard of the Catholic faith. Of the bishops of the sees
in Sinai only Beryllus, bishop of Aila, set his signature to
the declaration.<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a> And when Juvenal, bishop of Jerusalem
(451-458), returned to his see and declared his intention of
abiding by the decision, the fanatical monks seized the city,
turned him out and set the Egyptian monk Theodosius in
his place. It was in vain that Juvenal sought to settle
the matter by leniency. Theodosius ruled in Jerusalem during
twenty months. When he was finally expelled he fled to
Sinai. The emperor Marcian hereupon addressed a letter to
Bishop Macarius and the monks of Sinai, warning them
against Theodosius, who “went from place to place spreading
heresy, and who is now in Mount Sinai (ἐν τῷ Σινᾷ ὄρει)
where there are monasteries which are dear to you and which
have our respect, in which he is working against the true
belief.”<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> The emperor also wrote to Juvenal saying that he
had written about Theodosius and his adherents to “the
most worthy bishop Macarius, to the archimandrite and to the
monks,” warning them of his false arguments, and asking
them to eject him and hand him over with his satellites to
the prefect of the province.<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> It is unknown what became of it.</p>

<p>Other writings of the hermits give an insight into the
speculative zeal and boundless credulity of these devotees to
a simple life, to whom everything surprising appeared in the
light of a miracle. Collections of <i>Sayings of the Fathers</i>
(Verba Seniorum), and incidents in their lives, were a favourite
branch of literature at the time. Anastasius (<i>c.</i> 561-614),
a monk of Sinai, John Climacus († 609), who dwelt at Tholas,
and then at the convent, and John Moschus († 619), who
habitually dwelt in Jerusalem, but went about visiting,
were among those who collected anecdotes and sayings regarding
Sinai.</p>

<p>Pillar saints at this time were attracting attention near
Antioch. There was an older Simeon who died in 460, and
a younger Simeon who died in 596. A monk of Raithou went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
to Simeon hoping to be relieved of a demon. But Simeon
bade him return to Raithou, and there seek the assistance
of Father Andrew, who had the power of expelling demons.
Andrew spoke to Moschus of his power to do so, which he
attributed to Simeon Stylites.<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> Again, Mena, also of Raithou,
deserted his post and sought the pillar saint, who, aware of his
failing, bade him return, as Abbas Sergius told Moschus
(no. 118). There was also Eusebius who was accosted by
a man in monkish garb, who asked to be admitted into the
community. Eusebius bade him utter the word Trinity,
and he vanished (no. 119). Those who dwelt in remote
districts often died unattended. Some fishermen were borne
by contrary winds to Pteleos where they found in a cell the
bodies of two hermits, which they carried to Raithou for
burial (no. 120). Again, two hermits dwelt on an island in
the Red Sea, from which they went on shore for water. They
lost their boat, and were found dead on the island, one of
them having set down in writing that his comrade lived for
twenty-eight days without drinking, when he died, while he
himself had lasted thirty-seven days at the time of his writing
(no. 121). There was growing, at this time, a feeling that the
devotees to a simple life should remain stationary. John
Cilix, abbot of Raithou, who wrote comments on some of
the chapters of John Climacus’ <i>Ladder of Paradise</i>, praised a
monk who continued at Raithou for seventy years, living on
green meat and dates. He had been there himself for seventy-six
years, and he admonished the brethren in words recorded
by Moschus, “not to foul the place which the fathers had
cleared of demons,” and always to remain in residence (no. 115).</p>

<p>The collection of anecdotes of Anastasius, a monk of
Sinai, mentions several hermit settlements which have been
located in wadis near the convent, where ruins of huts and
garden walls remain to this day. According to a tradition
preserved at the convent, the monks in the peninsula at one
time were between six and seven thousand in number.<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a></p>

<p>Among these settlements was Malocha, perhaps situated
in the Wadi Malga, north of Ras Safsaf. This was at one
time the home of Epiphanius, who was so devoted to ascetic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
practices that he had the power of seeing demons (no. 21).<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a>
Malocha at another time harboured Stephen, whose plantation
was ravaged by animals, here called χορογρύλλοι, <i>i.e.</i> porkers,
possibly they were hyænas. But Stephen reared a leopard
(probably a panther) from a cub whom he set to guard his
plantation (no. 13). This Stephen originally occupied a cell
near the cave of Elijah, which he left for Sidde, “situated
about seventy miles from the tower,” perhaps in Wadi
Sidreh, a lower reach of the Wadi Umm Agraf. He then
returned to his cell where he found his two disciples and
died from exhaustion.<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> His body was conveyed to the
convent, where it was set up at the entrance to the crypt.
The <i>Perigraphe</i> of 1817 stated that “he is still at the convent,
not confined by coffin or sarcophagus, but standing upright
with crossed hands and bowed head.”<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a> And there the
shrivelled figure wearing hermit clothing remains standing to
the present day.</p>

<p>At Sidde we also hear of a hermit who was walking one
day in the desert and saw a Saracen approaching, whereupon
he “transformed himself into a palm tree.” It was only
another hermit, and so he returned to his natural appearance.</p>

<p>Many stories were told of John the Sabaite who dwelt for
a time at Malocha. He was walking one day across the
desert with the imperial ruler (<i>archiater</i>) Demetrios, when they
came upon the footmarks of a dragon. Demetrios proposed
that they should fly, but John said they would pray, whereupon
the “dragon,” was carried aloft and was thrown back to the
ground shattered to pieces (<i>Anast.</i>, no. 14). Another story
told of John the Sabaite shows how the imaginary world was
to these men the greater reality. He was dwelling in “the
most distant desert,” when a fellow monk came to see him, who,
in reply to his question how other monks fared, replied, They
are well, thanks to your prayers. He then asked after a
monk who had a bad reputation, and heard that there was no
change in his behaviour. Afterwards he fell asleep and had
a vision of the crucified Christ, and himself kneeling. But
Christ called to His angels and thrust him forth, since he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
passed judgment on a fellow monk, thus anticipating divine
judgment. As he was thrust forth, his cowl caught in the
gate and he lost it. He awoke, but the thought of his cowl
lost in his dream, showed him that God had withdrawn from
him, and he wandered in the desert seven years, eating no
bread, sleeping in the open and speaking to no one, until he
had another dream in which the Lord restored his cowl to
him (<i>Anast.</i>, no. 17).</p>

<p>John the Sabaite also dwelt at Arselao (a place not identified),
where he was approached by a female porker (or hyæna)
who laid her blind young at his feet. He mixed his spittle
with earth and applied it to the eyes of the creature which
became seeing. On the following day the mother-beast
reappeared dragging an enormous cabbage which she laid
at the feet of the old man. But he smiled, charging her with
stealing it from another man’s garden, and bade her take it
back, a command which she forthwith obeyed (<i>Anast.</i>, no. 15).</p>

<p>Arselao was the home also for a time of a certain George,
who was fetched to the convent to pray for oil, as the store
had given out, and “the road to Palestine was held by the
barbarians.” His prayers brought oil to the cask, like Elijah’s
to the widow’s cruse, and like that of the cruse, it never failed.
The cask was placed under the protection of the Virgin
(<i>Anast.</i>, no. 9). The need of oil led the monks to cultivate
the olive in their gardens, which they did with considerable
success, olives being among their produce which attracted
the attention of the Arab writers.</p>

<p>At Tholas, which was mentioned in the earlier accounts,
John Climacus dwelt for forty years, at the conclusion of which
he became head of the convent. The Wadi Tla’ah is one of
the few valleys which has preserved its character. Prof.
Palmer described it in glowing terms in the Ordnance Survey.</p>

<p>Another hermitage was at Gonda, situated fifteen miles
from the Holy Bush (<i>Anast.</i>, no. 31). John the Sabaite was
living here with Stephen of Cappadocia, when Father Martyrios
arrived with a youthful disciple, who was John Climacus.
John the Sabaite, having the gift of foresight, recognised the
future superior of the convent in him (<i>Anast.</i>, no. 6).</p>

<p>This Stephen of Cappadocia told John Moschus that he
was once in the church at Raithou when two men entered,
who were without clothes. No one saw them but himself.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
He followed them out and begged to be allowed to accompany
them. But they bade him stay where he was, and he saw
them walk away across the Red Sea (<i>Moschus</i>, no. 122).</p>

<p>There was also the monk Sisoeis, who dwelt in the
hermitage of St. Anthony between the Red Sea and Egypt,
where he was visited by a monk of Pharan who told him that
it was ten months since he had seen a human being. To
which Sisoeis replied that it was eleven months since he had
seen one himself.</p>

<p>The hermit life in Sinai was at its height when the lady
Etheria visited the peninsula, intent on identifying the sites of
which she had read in the Bible. Her eagerness seems to have
stirred the imagination of the monks, and led to decisions as
to localities which were accepted as authentic for centuries
to come. The account of Etheria calls for a few words of
comment.</p>

<p>The MS. of her journey was discovered in the library of
Arezzo by Gamurrini in 1883. It was incomplete and
its author was not named. Gamurrini provisionally
claimed it for St. Silvia of Aquitaine, and dated the journey
between 378 and 383. But the abbé Férotin<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> has since
pointed out that Valerius (<i>c.</i> 650), abbot of a monastery near
Astorga in Spain, wrote a letter “In praise of the blessed
Etheria,” in which he described how this nun “with a bold
heart undertook a journey across the world.” He mentioned
details of her journey which establish beyond a doubt that
the writer of the Arezzo account was meant.<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> A German
writer, Karl Meister, on the internal evidence of the account,
hereupon dated the journey between 534 and 539. But
he overlooked the fact that Etheria, in connection with her
visit to Seleucia, mentioned by name her dear friend, the
<i>diaconissa</i> Martbana, who is named also as one of the distinguished
women of the place by Basileus, bishop of Seleucia
who died in the year 456.<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a> There were convents in the south
of France before the close of the fifth century, as we know from
the rules drafted by Cæsarius, bishop of Arles (501-573);
the date of Etheria may be about 460.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>The MS. account discovered at Arezzo was incomplete.
But the account, in its complete form, was apparently in the
hands of Peter the Deacon when he compiled his little book
<i>On the Holy Places</i>, about the year 1157, for Guidobaldo, abbot
of Monte Cassino. In this book Peter cited passages found
in the account that was discovered at Arezzo together with
others which seem to be taken from the part of the work
which is wanting. In the account which follows, the initial
passages are quoted from the book of Peter on the assumption
that they were taken from the account of Etheria.</p>

<p>Etheria and her party entered and left Sinai from Egypt.</p>

<p>“Before you reach the holy Mount Syna, stands the fort
Clesma on the Red Sea which the Israelites passed dryshod.
The marks (<i>vestigia</i>) of the chariot of the Pharaoh are visible
in the ground to this day. But the wheels are farther apart
than those of the chariots (<i>currus</i>) of our days as they are seen
in the Roman empire, for between wheel and wheel is a space
of twenty-four feet or more, and the wheelruts (<i>orbitæ</i>) are two
feet wide. These marks of the Pharaoh’s chariot lead down
to the shore where he entered the sea when he wanted to
seize the Israelites. On the spot where the Pharaoh’s wheelruts
are visible, two signs are set up, one on the right, and one
on the left, like little columns (<i>columella</i>).<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a></p>

<p>Orosius (<i>c.</i> 400) in his <i>History of the Universe</i>, also mentioned
the marks of the chariot wheels of the Pharaoh, which were
still visible.<a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a> Cosmas Indicopleustes about the year 550 referred
to them as “a sign to unbelievers.”<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> The consensus of
opinion of these writers suggests the existence of some feature
that attracted attention. The word <i>Clysma</i> itself signified
beach or jetty. Perhaps the ruts were the marks made by
the keels of the boats that were hauled in, in which case
the little columns were perhaps the bollards on which the
ropes were worked.</p>

<p>“Beyond the place of crossing lay the desert Shur and
Mara with its two wells that were sweetened by Moses (probably
the Ayun Musa). Three days’ journey lay Arandara,
the place called Helim, where the river, in places, disappeared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
in the ground and where there was much herbage and many
palm trees. From the crossing of the Red Sea near Sur there
was no pleasanter place.” The description and the name
Arandara point to the present Wadi Gharandel.</p>

<p>Etheria was bent on seeing all the sites, including the
place where it rained manna, the cells with Hebrew writing,
the desert of Pharan “where there were neither fields nor
vineyards but water and palm trees,” the place Faran,
where Amalek opposed the Israelites, the place where the
Israelites called for water, and the place where Jethro met
Moses, his son-in-law, “the spot where Moses prayed while
Joshua fought Amalek, is a high, steep mountain above
Pharan, and where Moses prayed there is now a church”
(Petrus, ed. Geyer, p. 118). This was probably the church
mentioned above which was founded by Julian Sabbas.</p>

<p>From Pharan Etheria’s party moved to a place where the
mountains opened themselves out, and found a great valley
beyond which appeared “Syna, the holy Mount of God,”
which is united with the place where are the Graves of Lust
(<i>i.e.</i> Kibroth Hata-avah). The guards said that it was customary
to offer prayers. “So then we did.” From here to
the Mount of God it was perhaps four miles altogether, the
length of the valley being sixteen miles (c. 31) The plain
was presumably the present plain of Er Raha.</p>

<p>According to Etheria the Israelites waited in this plain
when Moses went up into the Mount of God&mdash;there was also
the place where the calf was made&mdash;it was the valley at the
head of which was the place where holy Moses was when he
fed the flocks of his father-in-law when God spoke to him
from the Burning Bush. But as their route was first to
ascend the Mount of God at the side from which they were
approaching because the ascent was easier, and then to
descend to the head of the valley where the Bush was, thence
retracing their steps so as to see the places mentioned in
Scripture, they spent the night at a certain monastery where
kindly monks dwelt and where they were all well received.
There was a church there and a priest (this place has not been
identified). It was the night preceding the Sabbath, and early
on the following morning they made the ascent of the mountains
one by one with the priests and the monks that lived there.
“And you must go straight down each mountain until you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
arrive at the foot of the central one, which is strictly called
Sinai. And so, Christ our God commanding us, and encouraged
by the prayers of the holy men who accompanied
us, although the labour was great, for I had to ascend on foot
because the ascent could not be made in a chair (<i>sella</i>), yet
I did not feel it.” At the fourth hour they reached the peak
of Sinai where the Law was given, the place where the majesty
of God descended on the day when the mountain smoked,
and then they found a church, small because the summit of
the mount where it stood was small, but with a large measure
of grace. They were joined by the priest of the monastery
who served the church, for no one permanently lived on the
mountain where was the cave and the church where holy
Moses was (c. 33). Passages were read of the book of Moses,
the party communicated and received a present of first fruits
(<i>pomis</i>) from the monks, and Etheria asked questions about
the various sites, including the cave where Moses was when
he ascended the mountain a second time to receive the tables
and “other sites, both those which we asked to see, and those
about which they themselves knew. But this I would have you
know, ladies, venerable sisters, that the mountains which we
had at first ascended without difficulty, were as hillocks compared
with the central one on which we were standing. And
yet they were so enormous that I thought I had never seen
higher, did not this central one overtop them by so much.
Egypt and Palestine, the Red Sea and the Parthenian (<i>i.e.</i>
Mediterranean) Sea, which leads to Alexandria, also the
boundless territories of the Saracens, we saw below us, hard
though it is to believe; all which things these holy men pointed
out to us” (c. 34). As a matter of fact, the Red Sea is not
visible from the Gebel Musa, but from the Gebel Katrîn.
Etheria’s mention of a church on the height, however, shows
it was the Gebel Musa she ascended.</p>

<p>From the Mount of God they descended to the mountain
joined to it called Horeb, where there was a church and where
they saw the cave where Elijah hid and the stone altar (<i>sic</i>)
which he built. This description and the later account of
Antoninus Martyr (cf. below) show that at this period Horeb
was accounted a different height from the Mount of the Law.
After seeing a great rock with a flat surface on which stood
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>Aaron and the seventy elders when Moses received the Law&mdash;“and
in the middle there is a sort of altar made of stones”&mdash;the
party began the descent at about the eighth hour and at
the tenth hour they reached the Bush; “it is alive to this
day and puts forth shoots.” Here there were many cells,
a church, and a garden with the Bush, and the party partook
of a light meal in the garden and remained the night (c. 35).
On the next day they explored and saw the following: the
place of the camp of the Israelites,&mdash;the place where the
calf was made, “a great stone is fixed in that place to this
day,”&mdash;the spot from which Moses watched the Israelites
dancing,&mdash;the rock on which the tables were broken,&mdash;the
dwelling places of the Israelites “of which the foundations
made in circular form remain to this day,”&mdash;the place where
the Israelites ran from gate to gate,&mdash;also the place where the
calf was burnt, and the stream out of which the Israelites
drank,&mdash;the place where the seventy received the spirit of
Moses (Num. xi. 25),&mdash;the place where the Israelites lusted
(Num. xi. 34),&mdash;the place where the camp took fire (Num.
xi. 2), and the place where it rained manna and quails. The
reader is aware that according to the Biblical account, these
latter sites were far removed from the spot where the Law was
given. “Thus having seen all the places which the sons of
Israel visited both going and returning,” Etheria and her
party started back to Pharan, distant thirty-five miles. They
then stayed at a station (<i>mansio</i>) in the desert of Pharan; then
near the coast, and then at Clysma (near the present Suez),
where they rested, “for we had stoutly made our way through
the soil of the desert.” Etheria had previously passed
through Goshen on her way from Egypt into Sinai; but she
now decided to follow up the places visited by the Israelites.
So she journeyed to Migdol “with its fort and an officer
commanding the soldiery in accordance with Roman discipline,”
and passed Epauleum (LXX for Pihahiroth) on the further
side of the water; and another fort “Balsefon”; also “Othon”
(LXX for Etham), Succoth and Pithom. “The present Pithom
is now a fort,” she wrote, and reached Hero, ancient Heroöpolis.
Here the party entered the borders of Egypt leaving behind
the territories of the Saracens (c. 39), and moved on to the
city of Rameses, described as a “come” (<i>i.e.</i> κώμη) situated
near the present Tell er Rotab. Finally they reached “the
city of Arabia,” and met its bishop. Probably the ancient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
Per-Sopd, later Phacusa, the capital of the nome, is meant. A
bishop of Phacusa is mentioned.<a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a> From here the road went
“from the Thebaid to Pelusium by way of Tathnis,” probably
the Greek Daphne, the Tahpanhes of Jeremiah, following the
course of an arm of the Nile to Pelusium. Etheria had been
before on her way to Alexandria. She now journeyed along
the coast “passing several stations,” and then entered
Palestine (<i>c.</i> 40).</p>

<p>The detailed account by Etheria and her location of the
various holy sites in Sinai was the first of its kind, and
apparently remained the only one for centuries to come. Before
her pilgrimage we only hear of a church built above the valley
of Pharan which commemorated the struggle between Moses
and the Amalekites, while the Bush, Horeb, and Elim were
names of settlements which had been chosen by the monks
in remembrance of Moses and Elijah whom they accepted as
their patrons. On the same basis a monastery or laura near
Jerusalem, mentioned as the abode of John Moschus, was called
Pharan. The names which were given to settlements in Sinai
may have caused these places to be looked upon as those that
were actually visited by Moses and Elijah.</p>

<p>The “Bush” was mentioned without further comment by
Ammonius (<i>c.</i> 372) as a settlement. It was described as the
“Bush at the foot of the mountain where God conferred with
the people” by Nilus (<i>c.</i> 449). About the same time Etheria
(<i>c.</i> 450) spoke of “a church in the place where the Bush is,
which Bush is alive to this day,” while Procopius, the secretary
of Justinian, remarked (<i>c.</i> 550) in a more cautious strain,
“here it was that Moses was said to have received the Laws
from God and proclaimed them.” It was Etheria who
claimed to have seen during a single day all the places visited
by the Israelites including, in the plain below, Taberah, the
place of Burning (Num. xi. 2) and Kibroth Hata-avah (Num.
xi. 34), where the Israelites stayed long after they left the
holy mountain.</p>

<p>The monkish settlement Horeb or Choreb was mentioned
also by Ammonius (<i>c.</i> 372), and, judging from his description,
it was quite separate from that of the Bush. As a height,
Horeb was also held separate from the Mountain of the Law
both by Etheria and by Antoninus. But Etheria, and others<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
after her, looked upon Horeb not only as the site to which
Elijah fled after crossing the desert, but as identical with the
place where he set up the great altar at which he confounded
the prophets of Baal.</p>

<p>Elim, again, was mentioned as a monkish settlement by
Ammonius (<i>c.</i> 372), and his description leaves no doubt that
Raithou near the present Tur on the coast, two days’ journey
from the Bush, is meant. This settlement retained its name,
Elim, till recent times. Some of the mediæval pilgrims looked
upon it as the actual Elim of the Bible. Thus the Ritter von
Harff, who visited it in 1497, held that the Israelites here
left the Red Sea, and asserted that bones that lay on the
shore were those of the pursuing Egyptians. But Etheria
and Cosmas (<i>c.</i> 550) with a better appreciation of possibilities,
located the passage of the Israelites near Clysma (near the
present Suez), and sought Elim of the Bible, not at Raithou,
but at Arandara, the present Wadi Gharandel.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XII</h2>

<p class="pch">THE BUILDING OF THE CONVENT</p>

<p class="drop-cap04">FROM the reign of the emperor Justinian (527-563) dates
the fortification of the hermit settlement known as the
Bush, which was thereby transformed into a convent, and as
such, braved the vicissitudes of many centuries. The fortification
was apparently part of a wider scheme by which the
emperor used the peninsula of Sinai as a bulwark against the
invasion from the east. Movements among the Eastern
people were threatening the frontier line of the Roman empire
at the time, and its internal organisation was by no means
secure.</p>

<p>The care which was bestowed on the convent itself may
have been due to the favour which the monophysite form of
belief found for a time with Justinian, and more especially
with his wife, the empress Theodora († 548). It was owing
to her influence that Anthimus I was raised to the see of
Constantinople, but a synod convened in the year 536 deposed
him. At this synod there were present Paulus II, bishop of
Aila,<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a> and Theonas, who described himself as “presbyter
of Holy Mount Syna, and legate of the church of Pharan and
the hermitage of Raithou.”<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a> Theonas apparently acted as
legate owing to the age and infirmity of Photius, bishop of
Pharan. His appointment shows the close connection that
existed at the time between the three chief hermit settlements
in Sinai proper. The presence of Theonas at Constantinople
no doubt furthered, if it did not originate, the
idea of fortifying the convents of Sinai.</p>

<p>The building activity of Justinian began about the year
535. Procopius, his secretary, wrote an account of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
relations with Sinai and described the life of the monks
as “a careful study of death.” They therefore sought the
solitude that was dear to them. The emperor, he says,
built a church for them which was dedicated to the Theotokos,
so that they might spend their life in continual prayer in
the service of God, not on the summit of the mountain, but
below it, for on the summit thunder and other heavenly
phenomena were heard at night, which made it impossible
to spend the night there. Here it was that Moses is said to
have received the Laws of God and proclaimed them. At
the foot of the mountain Justinian built a military station,
so that the Saracens might not unawares attack Palestine.<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a></p>

<p>A later age produced a decree of Justinian dated to 551,
which declared the independence of the foundation. The
decree is no doubt a forgery, but the independent standing
of the convent was generally accepted. The terms of the
alliance which secured the safety of the settlement were first
set forth by Said ibn Batrick, otherwise Eutychius, patriarch
of Alexandria (933-40), to whom we owe a full account of
the building of the convent.</p>

<p>“The monks of Sinai,” he wrote, “hearing of the piety
of Justinian, and the delight that he took in building churches
and monasteries, went to him and described how the Ishmaelite
Arabs harmed them by plundering their food stores,
invading and emptying their cells, and entering their churches
where they devoured the eucharist. When the emperor
enquired into their wishes, they said: We beg for a monastery
in which we shall be safe. For at that time there was no
convent building in which the monks could congregate. They
dwelt scattered in the mountains and along the valleys near
the Bush from which the Lord spoke to Moses, having only
a large tower above the Bush which is standing to this day,
and a church dedicated to the Virgin, where they sought
protection when those approached whom they dreaded.
The emperor despatched with them a legate with full authority
to the prefect of Egypt, asking that he should be supplied
with building materials, with men and provisions in Egypt.
He was charged to build a monastery at Kelzem (Clysma),
and a monastery at Raya (Raithou), and one on Mount
Sinai, this to be so fortified that no better could be found.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>”
After building the church of St. Athanasius at Clysma, and
the monastery at Raithou, the legate came into Sinai, where
he found the Bush in a narrow valley with the tower near it,
also bubbling springs and the monks scattered along the
valleys. He intended building the monastery on the summit
of the mountain, leaving the Bush and the tower below,
but he altered his plan because of the lack of water on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
mountain, and built the monastery near the Bush enclosing
the tower, and a church on the summit of the mountain
where Moses accepted the Law. The name of the superior
was Doulas. But the change of plan so annoyed the emperor
that it cost the legate his life.</p>

</div></div>

<p>In order to safeguard the building, Roman slaves were
brought from the Black Sea (traditionally from Wallachia),
a hundred in number, and transferred to Sinai with their
wives and children, together with a hundred men with their
wives and children from Egypt. Dwellings were erected
for them in Mount Sinai so that they might safeguard the
monastery and the monks; they received their supplies from
Egypt. Their settlement was known as the Deir Abid (<i>i.e.</i>
monastery of slaves), and their descendants continued there
till the spread of the Moslim faith. Moreover the Benu
Saleh were appointed to act as <i>ghafirs</i> or protectors to the
monks, that is, they were responsible for those moving to
and fro across the desert, in return for which they received
largess in the form of food.<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> The same terms were mentioned
by Makrizi († 1441) in his <i>History of the Copts</i>,<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a> and by the
<i>Perigraphe</i> in its Arabic translation of the year 1710.<a name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a>
According to this the Benu Saleh, the Saidi and the Halig
(Aleyat) were attached to the service of the convent which,
in return, supplied them with food.</p>

<p>The importance which the agreement attached to the
Benu Saleh, was in keeping with the ancient establishment
of this tribe in the peninsula, and their association with
rites of religious importance in close vicinity to Gebel Musa
and on Gebel Musa itself. The tomb of Nebi Saleh lies in
the Wadi Sheykh at a distance of a few miles from the convent.
It is the scene of an annual tribal festival which concludes
with a pilgrimage half-way up the Gebel Musa, where a sheep
is sacrificed over a natural hole in the rock. This is looked
upon as a footprint of the holy camel, no doubt originally of
the Naga, which was the creation of Nebi Saleh.</p>

<p>Early references and the nature of the festival leave no
doubt as to its antiquity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus, the writer Antoninus Martyr, who, about the year
530, entered Sinai from Gaza, journeyed by way of Elath
(Elusa), “at the beginning of the desert that goes to Sinai,”
and mentioned a festival that was about to take place. The
people who entered the greater desert were in number
twelve thousand (c. 36). On the eighth day after leaving
Gaza, he reached the place where Moses brought forth water
from the rock, and came to Horeb, which, in his estimation,
was distinct from Sinai.</p>

<p>“Mount Syna,” he wrote, “is stony, and there is little
earth, and in its neighbourhood are many cells of men who
serve God, the same in Horeb. And in this part of the
mountain the Saracens have an idol of marble white as snow.
A priest (<i>sacerdos</i>) of theirs dwells there, who wears a dalmatica
and a linen cloak (<i>pallium</i>). And when the time of
their festival comes previous to the appearance of the moon
(<i>præcurrente lunæ</i>), before it appears on the festive day,
the marble begins to change its colour, and when they begin
to adore it, the marble is black as pitch. The time of the
festival being over, it returns to its former colour. At this
I wondered greatly.”<a name="FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a></p>

<p>The rites that are accounted holy in this neighbourhood
are associated with different prophets. Prof. E. H. Palmer
(† 1882) remarked that the Bedawyn “often fail to discriminate
between Nebi Saleh, Moses and Mohammad. Thus,
the footprint of the camel which was venerated at the conclusion
of the festival of Nebi Saleh, has been incorporated in a
tradition regarding Mohammad, who after death was carried
aloft by a camel of so prodigious a size that it stood with one
foot in Damascus, one in Cairo, one in Mecca, and one in Sinai.”<a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a></p>

<p>The monk Antoninus Martyr made a short stay at the
convent, and wrote that “the days of the festival of the
Ishmaelites were drawing to a close, and the order went forth
that no one should remain in the desert through which we
had come, so some returned to the Holy City (<i>i.e.</i> Jerusalem)
through Egypt, others through Arabia” (c. 39).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>The work of feeding the Arabs who came to the convent
was no mean undertaking. Anastasius, the monk, wrote that
the Armenians more especially came there,&mdash;“it was their
custom as it was the custom of every one.” There were six
hundred of them on one occasion, and a man among
them who waited on them and then disappeared. In the
estimation of Anastasius this was “Moses himself, who came to
receive his visitors” (no. 7). The number of pilgrims at this
time (<i>c.</i> 600) was less, he remarked, than thirty years before,
when as many as eight hundred came and ascended the holy
mountain, where they saw a vision of God and a miracle,
the summit of the mountain appearing enveloped in fire
(no. 38). The appearance of fire on the mountain had
previously been mentioned by Ammonius about the year 372.
It may have formed part of a system of signalling adopted
by the Bedawyn.</p>

<p>This confusion between the different prophets is reflected
in a statement in the <i>Perigraphe</i> in the Arabic translation
of 1710, which described Saleh as a Christian who had his
tomb not far from the monastery.<a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a> This tradition should
be compared with one current in the Middle Ages that
Mohammad the Prophet was the disciple of a Christian monk.</p>

<p>The tomb of Saleh in the Wadi Sheykh was noticed by
Bishop Pococke in 1726 (i. 141), and Burckhardt, in 1816,
mentioned the celebration held here which took place in the
last week in May (p. 489). This festival was described in detail
by Tischendorf who saw it in 1846,<a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a> and by Prof. E. H. Palmer,
who witnessed it in June of 1870.<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a></p>

<p>The festival took place at the time when the dates ripened,
and lasted three days. Tribes from all parts of the peninsula,
including women and children, assembled in the Wadi Sheykh
near the insignificant-looking tomb which consisted of a
domed chamber cemented over, with an empty coffin standing
inside. Pieces of cloth, ostrich eggs, tassels and other parts
of camel equipment were brought as offerings and suspended
from the roof. The first step in the festivity consisted in
renovating and whitewashing the tomb. In a large tent
erected outside forty to fifty men assembled and sat in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
circle, while the first of all the sheykhs barefoot and wearing
the white garment (<i>Imam</i>) and a white turban over his red
fez, sat near the fire. A procession headed by the women
encircled the tomb. The young men then brought out fifty
to sixty lambs which were cut on the forehead, and blood
was drawn before they were slaughtered, skinned and cut
up. While the food was boiling a camel race took place, four
to six camels racing at a time. Four to six persons then
sat around each lambskin which was spread on the ground,
and on it their share of boiled lambs’ flesh was poured out,
which they ate using their fingers. Besides the flesh there
were meal-cakes (<i>bilaw</i>), and water to drink. A dance followed
in which men and women took part, and which was timed
to singing and clapping of hands. Besides this, two women
danced figures outside the group. Men and women remained
conversing in couples till late at night. The celebration struck
Tischendorf as dignified. At its conclusion some of the
Bedawyn repaired to the summit of the Gebel Musa, where
there stood a small and highly revered mosque (mentioned
as early as 1335), which they entered, wearing the <i>Imam</i> or
white garment. Over the natural hole, called the footprint
of the prophet’s she-camel, they sacrificed a sheep.</p>

<p>A further festivity took place in former days near the
summit of the Gebel Musa which we hear of in the sixteenth
century only and not again. Early writers agree that no hermit
or monk ever spent a night on the summit of the mountain.
Nilus (<i>c.</i> 400) remarked that the height was generally avoided
“since God conferred there with the people,” while Etheria
and Antoninus Martyr simply noted that no hermit spent the
night there. This fact Procopius (<i>c.</i> 550) connected with
“heavenly phenomena.” At a later date the hermit Simeon,
for a time, dwelt “on the summit of Mount Sinai, where
the Law was given, a place deserted because of the restless
Arabs.”</p>

<p>This avoidance of the mountain-top at night by the
Christians finds its explanation in the account of Gregor,
prior of the Carthusian house of Gaming, who came into
Sinai with Martin Baumgarten and others in the year 1507.
The party decided to spend the night on the Mount of the
Law, where the building that was close to the summit was the
scene of a Saracen festivity of so noisy a character, that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
Christian pilgrims hardly slept all night. It included “a
bestial service in the belief that those who were here conceived
were endowed with a holy and prophetic spirit” (proles
enim hic concepta, sancto et prophetico spiritu plena ab eis
æstimatur).<a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a> The spot chosen seems to have been a cave
between the chapel of Moses and the small mosque. Similar
unions led, from the same belief according to Tobler, to the
desecration at one time of the holy cave at Bethlehem.<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a> This
cave, according to a statement of Jerome, was connected with
the cult of Adonis in ancient times. Perhaps the hold which
the Saracens had on the Gebel Musa in early days was
another reason why the convent builder chose the lower site.</p>

<p>No further mention is made of the church of St. Athanasius
which the emperor Justinian had constructed at Clysma.
The monastery which he built or fortified at Raithou frequently
served as a refuge to the monks of the convent in times of
stress. Its church was dedicated to St. John the Baptist,
and continued till the period of Turkish domination when it
was destroyed.</p>

<p>The convent of the Bush alone continued. It had an
independent standing, perhaps owing to its being originally
merged with the bishopric of Pharan. The head of the house
was chosen from its inmates, and he called himself bishop.
Later he assumed the title of archbishop. Owing, however,
to his peculiar standing he was referred to as archbishop at
a time when he called himself bishop only, as we shall see
later.</p>

<p>The convent at first served as the nucleus of the numerous
hermitages in southern Sinai. Later, as these disappeared,
it continued in proud isolation. In addition to the house at
Raithou, it acquired property and built priories in many
outlying districts, and rose to a position of importance that
was in every way exceptional.</p>

<p>The convent retains to this day its original appearance.
It is enclosed by walls built of well-dressed blocks of grey
granite forming an irregular quadrangle, 280 feet at its greatest
length, and 250 ft. at its greatest breadth. The walls enclosed
the old tower, a church, and the convent buildings, with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
cells for the monks, a guest-house, bakeries, stables, and a
library. Adjoining these buildings was the garden, which
extended on one side, along the valley about 200 feet, with
several springs of good water, and plantations of fruit trees,
including olive, pomegranate, almond and peach, pear and
apple trees. The produce of these remained famous throughout
the Middle Ages.</p>

<p>The church was a basilica in the Byzantine style. It was
lighted by five windows on either side, and the entablature of
the nave rested on round arches which were supported by six
pairs of granite columns with leafy capitals. The roof was
of cypress wood covered with lead, and contained three contemporary
inscriptions. One of these commemorated “our
holy king, Justinian the Great;” another was devoted to
the memory of Theodora, who died in 548; the third called
a blessing on the builder, Stephanos and his family. “Lord
God, who didst appear on this spot, save and bless thy slave
Stephanos, the builder of this monastery, from Aila, and Nonna
(his wife), and give rest to the souls of their children, George,
Sergius, and Theodora.”<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a></p>

<p>The church was dedicated to the Virgin, as we learn from
Eutychius, whose statement was confirmed by Magister
Thietmar in 1217, and by the Papal Bull of 1226. In the Middle
Ages it was sometimes spoken of as the church of St. Katherine,
and later still as the church of the Transfiguration. The
latter name was due to a great mosaic representation on the apse
which is shown by its style to belong to the seventh or eighth
century. The mosaic was first drawn and described by Laborde
and Linant.<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a> On this mosaic the youthful Christ was represented
soaring towards heaven, with Elijah on one side pointing
to Him, while Moses on the other side stands with hand
upraised. John is seen kneeling, James also is represented
kneeling, Peter is prostrate. Each figure is named. This scene
is framed by thirty medallions, which represent the Twelve
Apostles, Paul, the superior of the convent, who is not named,
and sixteen prophets. Above, to the right, Moses is seen
kneeling before the Bush; to the left, he is represented
holding the Tables. Below, are two angels with extended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
wings and two further portraits of which the one shows
a bearded man with flowing locks, the other a woman with
close-fitting head-dress. They are sometimes pointed out as
Constantine and Helena, sometimes as Justinian and Theodora,
but their identity remains unknown. Below, stand the words
in Greek, “In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy
Ghost, the whole of this work was executed for the salvation
of those who contributed towards it by Longinus, most
holy priest and superior (τοῦ ὀσιωτάτου πρεσβυτέρον καὶ
ἡγουμένου).”<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a> The floor was covered with a mosaic which
was torn up by the Arab treasure seekers in the fifteenth
century, but restored by Bishop Anastasius (1583-1592).</p>

<p>Two crypts inside the convent walls served to house the
bones of the dead. Their corpses were first laid for two or
three years on an iron grating in a cellar; the skull was then
transferred to one crypt and the bones to the other. The
bones were sorted and added to the piles of corresponding
bones, so that the femurs, the tibias, etc., lie piled together.
The archbishops’ corpses were, however preserved intact, and,
wearing their robes,<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a> were placed in mummy coffins. The use
of the iron grating and the crypts dates back to the earliest
days of the convent, for among the stories collected by
Anastasius, one described how two corpses were laid side
by side on the grating, but the one, disliking the proximity
of the other, repeatedly moved, throwing it out of place,
until it was officially adjured not to do so.</p>

<p>The convent included a hostel for the aged and for pilgrims,
built by a certain Isaurus (<i>quodam Isauro</i>). It attracted
the attention of Pope Gregory the Great (592-604), who,
hearing of it, forwarded to John Climacus, who was superior
at the time, woollen coverings and bedding for fifteen beds,
together with money wherewith to purchase feather-beds.
At the same time he wrote to Father Palladius, to whom he
forwarded a cowl or tunic. The Pope had previously written
to John Climacus, complimenting him on having reached a
harbour of safety while others were tossing on a sea of religious
difficulties.<a name="FNanchor_204_204" id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> He seems to have made a permanent grant to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
the convent. A pilgrim of 1341 mentioned that the day
of St. Gregory was kept at the convent, since he had bestowed
on it alms out of the treasury of the Church, by which the
number of convent inmates was raised to four hundred.</p>

<p>The interest which Pope Gregory took in the convent was
probably connected with a pilgrimage made by the Roman
patrician lady Rusticiana. In the year 592 she took her
daughter, who was ill, to Sinai in the hope of effecting a cure.
The husband of the daughter was also of the party. They
started from Constantinople and returned sooner than was
expected. This we learn from a letter which Rusticiana wrote
to Pope Gregory.<a name="FNanchor_205_205" id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a></p>

<p>In Sinai the monk Anastasius recorded the visit of a
patrician lady who came with her daughter and wished to
consult Father Orontius, “who was so filled with divine fire
that he could hold his hand in the flame, and burn incense on
the palm of his hand.” On one occasion, however, he lost
a finger by burning. But Orontius refused to see the ladies,
he sent them some grapes instead. When the demon who
was in the daughter, saw the grapes, he cried out: Father
Orontius, why do you come here? And he departed out of
her (no. 18). It was doubtless the same hermit, in this case
called Orontos, who once came into church with his cowl all
awry. When his attention was drawn to it, he said that all
things being awry in the church, his cowl was in keeping with
them. If they would set things straight there, he would see
to his cowl.</p>

<p>A great feature of the convent of Sinai was its library,
where the monks amassed books and manuscripts, and added
to the world’s literature by copying and writing. The place
was a polyglot centre. Antoninus Martyr found three Fathers
there who spoke Latin, Greek, Syriac, Egyptian (Coptic),
and Bessam (Persian), and many interpreters in each language
(c. 37). The hermit Simeon, who came into Europe about
the year 1025, spoke Egyptian, Syriac, Arabic, Greek and
Roman (<i>i.e.</i> Latin).</p>

<p>The contents of the library, in spite of losses incurred at
different times, are still considerable. Among its most
notable treasures was the <i>Codex Sinaiticus</i>, dated to about the
year 400, which helped to revise the text of most of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
Greek Old Testament, of the New Testament, and of some
important early Christian works, including the <i>Shepherd of
Hermas</i>. Attention was attracted to this <i>Codex</i> by Tischendorf,
who came to the convent in 1844 to inspect the MSS.,
and having identified some of its pages, returned in 1853,
in 1854, and in 1859, when he finally acquired it for Petrograd,
a facsimile copy being deposited at the convent. A few
leaves are at Leipzig. Another notable treasure was a
Syriac <i>Codex</i> of the Gospels of a very early date, which was
discovered as a palimpsest and photographed by the sisters,
Mrs. Smith-Lewis and Mrs. Gibson, in 1893. Again, there
was the <i>Evangeliarium Theodosianum</i>, a collection of passages
from the New Testament written in gold lettering on parchment,
which was seen and described by Burckhardt in 1816,
and is dated to about the year 1000.</p>

<p>The Greek MSS. that are in the library were recently
examined and catalogued by Prof. Gardthausen of Oxford.
The list contains 1230 entries of MSS. that are all of a religious
character. Prof. Gardthausen noted the names of over two
hundred scribes, and other details which show that some of
the MSS. came from Crete, Cairo, and Cyprus.<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a> The Syriac and
Palestinian-Syriac MSS. were catalogued by the ladies Smith-Lewis
and Gibson. They are over three hundred in number.
The Christian Arabic MSS. catalogued by the same ladies,
amounted to six hundred and eighty entries.<a name="FNanchor_207_207" id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a></p>

<p>The importance which was secured to the convent reacted
on the standing of the bishopric of Pharan, the representative
of which seems to have removed to the convent. When
Peter, patriarch of Jerusalem, (524-544) summoned his bishops
to a synod in 538, Photius, bishop of Pharan, who was close
upon seventy years of age, was “unable to leave Mount
Sinai,” which suggests that he lived there. Stephen of
Cappadocia, mentioned above, Dulcetius and Zosimus were
deputed to represent him. We again hear of Zosimus as one
of three monks of Sinai, whom Apollinaris, the orthodox or
Melkite patriarch of Alexandria (550-568), summoned to
Alexandria. Of these he consecrated Theodor bishop of
Leontopolis, an unnamed monk, bishop of Heliopolis, and
Zosimus bishop of Babylon (Cairo). But Zosimus had no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
taste for the episcopate, and soon returned to his cell in
Sinai.<a name="FNanchor_208_208" id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a></p>

<p>Likewise do we hear that Gregorius, who had presided over
the monks in Sinai, was chosen to succeed Anastasius, bishop
of the see of Antioch who was evicted in the year 569.
According to information provided by Evagrius (593), he
had there been besieged by the Kenite Arabs.<a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> The country
generally seems to have been at the mercy of the Arabs,
which resulted in the abandonment of the hermitages, while it
added to the prestige of the convent.</p>

<p>About this time the convent became the home of a young
monk who was always silent. He was the only surviving son
of the emperor Maurice, and was saved by his nurse when all
the other sons were put to death by Phocas (602-608).<a name="FNanchor_210_210" id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a> When
he died his body disappeared. “Perhaps it was carried by
God to the realms of the living,” was the verdict of the monk
Anastasius (no. 29).</p>

<p>The last bishop of Pharan we hear of was Theodor, who
proposed the so-called monothelite modification of the monophysite
doctrine, hoping thereby to secure re-union with the
Church. In its interest he went to Constantinople, where
he was honourably entertained by the patriarch Sergius
(610-638), who impressed Pope Honorius (625-638) in Theodor’s
favour. Objection was, however, raised to the new doctrine
by the monk Sophronius, who later became patriarch of
Jerusalem (634-638), and disapproval of it was expressed by
the Lateran Synod of 649,<a name="FNanchor_211_211" id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a> and by the Sixth General Council
of Constantinople in 681.</p>

<p>In the Wadi Feiran lie the ruins of a convent and a church
of some importance which were described by the <i>Ordnance
Survey</i> (i. 210), and are without doubt the remains of the
episcopal seat of Pharan.</p>

<p class="pch">MOHAMMAD AND ST. KATHERINE</p>

<p class="drop-cap04">THE collapse of the Roman power in the East prepared
the way for the Moslim conquest of Sinai and
Egypt. During the lifetime of Mohammad changes were
effected along peaceful lines. The efforts of the Prophet
were directed, in the first place, against standing abuses and
obsolete customs in Arabia itself. But the strong desire for
expansion westwards among the Arabs drew his attention
outside the limits of Arabia proper, and we hear of his entering
into relation with neighbouring centres. Thus it is said that
Tahhieh Ibn Robah of the port of Aila, waited on the Prophet
when he was staying at Tarbuk, and that he received from
him a woollen garment in return for paying a poll-tax. Ibn
Ishak cited by Makrizi († 1441) stated that thus <i>firmân</i> was
dated to the ninth year of the Hegira, <i>i.e.</i> 530-531, and assured
protection to Tahhieh, the people of Aila, the bishop and all
on land and water. “And the city did not cease to prosper.”<a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a></p>

<p>The garment which Makrizi called a cloak of the Prophet,
was subsequently purchased by the Caliph of the Benu el
Abbas. Aila continued to flourish, and Mukaddisi (<i>c.</i> 985)
described “Wailah” as “a populous and beautiful city among
many palm trees with fish in plenty, and the great port of
Palestine and emporium of the Hedjaz,” but the true Aila
lies near by it and is now in ruins.<a name="FNanchor_213_213" id="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a></p>

<p>A later age claimed that the convent of Sinai also secured
a <i>firmân</i> under the hand of the Prophet. It was alleged that
Mohammad, on one of his journeys with Ali, alighted under
the wall of the convent, and that Ali penned the <i>firmân</i>, to
which Mohammad, who could not write, set the mark of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
blackened hand. The monks told Burckhardt that the
Ottoman Sultan Selim, after the conquest of Egypt (<span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1517),
appropriated it and carried it off to Constantinople, but that
a copy of it remained with the monks. This he was shown,
but declared it to be a forgery.<a name="FNanchor_214_214" id="FNanchor_214_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a> Bishop Pococke also saw
another copy of it in Cairo, which he copied, and of which he
published a translation in the appendix to his book. It
claims to have been written in the second year of the Hegira,
and granted protection to the Nazarenes, declaring that the
places where the monks dwelt should be protected; also that
they were exempt from paying the poll-tax, and should receive
tithes, and that the Christians generally should not be called
upon to pay a poll-tax exceeding ten drachmæ.<a name="FNanchor_215_215" id="FNanchor_215_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a></p>

<p>The followers of the Prophet, after overrunning Syria,
attacked Egypt. They seized Damietta which was governed
by Abu Thour, a Christian Arab, and were opposed by an
army of 20,000 men. But Abu Thour was seized, and the
invaders spread into Egypt. The descendants of Abbas,
the uncle of the Prophet, now reigned over large possessions,
of which Egypt was part, from the year 750 to 868. After
a break the old line of rulers returned from 905 to 969.</p>

<p>Under the Moslim system of administration the whole
of Sinai was included in the province Hedjaz, which comprised
Tur, Faran, Raya (<i>i.e.</i> Raithou), Kolzoum (<i>i.e.</i> Clysma),
Aila, Midian, and its territory, El Oweid, El Hamr (or El
Hour), Beda and Shaghb.<a name="FNanchor_216_216" id="FNanchor_216_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a> The Christians were declared a
tolerated sect, but they were sorely oppressed under Abd-el-Melek
ibn Merwan (705-708), and by Qurrah Sherig (709-714).</p>

<p>During the reign of Abd-el-Melek (705-708) an attack was
directed against the convent of Sinai, where many of the slave
population, who had been settled there by Justinian, were
slain, others fled, others became Moslim,&mdash;“whose descendants
to this day remain in the monastery and are called Benu
Saleh, being reckoned their descendants,&mdash;from them sprang
the Lachmienses.” The monks themselves destroyed the
houses of the slaves, lest anyone should dwell there and they
are in ruins at the present day (<i>c.</i> 930).<a name="FNanchor_217_217" id="FNanchor_217_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a></p>

<p>It is related in an appendix to the stories of Anastasius<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
how the Christian Saracens, who dwelt near the tower of
Pharan and the Holy Bush, sought refuge in the holy mountain,
but could not resist the numerous invaders, and therefore
decided to accept the faith of the Prophet. One man was about
to fly, when his wife begged him to kill her and the children
rather than leave them at the mercy of the barbarians. He
did so, and then fled to Horeb, where, like Elijah, he dwelt
with wild beasts till he felt the approach of death. Then he
repaired to the Holy Bush, where he lay in the guest-house,
and where “some of the monks, still among the living,”
saw him and heard him describe the shining figures which
he saw approaching as he lay on the point of death. “They
were, I believe, the angelic bands of the martyrs who came
forth to greet him” (no. 45).</p>

<p>In Egypt itself, the Christians continued to be oppressed.
A government survey, undertaken by the minister of finance,
Obeidallah Ben Hab-Hab, resulted in a poll-tax being levied
on them in addition to the usual land-tax. Again, Osanna
ben Said el Tanuchi confiscated the property of the Christians,
branded each monk with a sign on the hand, and he who had
no sign forfeited his hand. Hence the Copts of Egypt to this
day are marked with a cross on the hand. Moreover, every
Christian who had no legitimation papers was mulcted ten
dinars. In 737, in 750, and again in 831 or 852 the Copts of
Egypt were in revolt.<a name="FNanchor_218_218" id="FNanchor_218_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a></p>

<p>In spite of the Arab conquest, Sinai, like Jerusalem and
Rome, continued to stand out as a goal of Christian pilgrimage.
According to the account of a monk of Redon in Brittany,
a certain Fromont and his brother, men of high standing,
went there. They had murdered their uncle, an ecclesiastic,
and repented, and went before King Lothair (855-859). His
bishops decreed that the brothers should be chained and
bound together and should do penance by going to Rome,
Jerusalem and Sinai. In Rome they were received by Pope
Benedict III (858-888), who gave them his blessing, and they
took boat for Jerusalem, where they spent several years.
From there they went into the Thebaid, where they fasted with
the monks, and they finally reached Sinai, where they spent
three years. Still wearing the chains that bound them
together, they returned by way of Rome to Rennes, where the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
one brother died. Fromont then went to Redon, and once
more started for Rome. But he returned to Redon where,
his penance being at an end, his chain was taken from him,
and where he died.<a name="FNanchor_219_219" id="FNanchor_219_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a> Bishop Pococke was shown a cell
some way up the Gebel Musa where two brothers dwelt who
were chained together.<a name="FNanchor_220_220" id="FNanchor_220_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a> The brothers from Rennes are probably
meant.</p>

<p>Another account which seems to date from the first half
of the ninth century described the Houses of God, and thus
described Sinai. “In holy Mount Sina there are four churches,
one where the Lord spoke to Moses on the summit of the
mountain; one dedicated to St. Elijah; another dedicated
to St. Elisæus; and a fourth in the monastery of St. Mary.
The abbot is Elias, who has under him thirty monks. The steps
that lead up and down the mountain are 7700 in number.”<a name="FNanchor_221_221" id="FNanchor_221_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a></p>

<p>A list of the “archbishops” of Sinai was compiled at the
convent in the seventeenth century, which begins with Marcus,
whose date is given as 869.<a name="FNanchor_222_222" id="FNanchor_222_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a> But the official report of the
Fourth Synod held at Constantinople, in 869-870, contains
the signature of Constantine, bishop of Syna.<a name="FNanchor_223_223" id="FNanchor_223_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a> Another
bishop was Jorius, who died and was enshrined in Bethune in
Belgium in the year 1033. A hymn there written in his honour
described him as “bishop of Sinai.”<a name="FNanchor_224_224" id="FNanchor_224_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a> He was probably
travelling for the purpose of collecting alms for his convent.</p>

<p>From the historian Rodolfus Glaber (<i>c.</i> 900-1044) we
hear that the dukes of Normandy, more especially Duke
William (927-942) and his successors, were liberal in their gifts
to churches and convents, and that monks from Mount Sinai
came every year to Rouen, from where they departed loaded
with gifts (<i>exenia</i>) in gold and silver.<a name="FNanchor_225_225" id="FNanchor_225_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a> It was in connection
with these grants that the fame of St. Katherine of Alexandria
spread to Europe in the course of the eleventh century.</p>

<p>The cult of St. Katherine, virgin saint and martyr, is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
among the curious developments of legendary history, for
her name appears for the first time about three hundred years
after her reputed existence. She is first named in the <i>Life of
Paulus Junior</i> († 956), who was called a Latro from Mons
Latrus, where he dwelt. The account of his life was written
by a contemporary.<a name="FNanchor_226_226" id="FNanchor_226_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a> It describes how three hundred monks
from Sinai and Raithou sought refuge in Mount Latrus in
Karia from the persecutions of the Saracens (<span class="smcap">c.</span> 8).</p>

<p>The monks continued in close connection with Sinai.
Gabriel sang the Psalms of David as he had done at the Bush,
and when a pilgrimage was undertaken to pray for rain,
Gabriel obtained the desired result (<span class="smcap">c.</span> 18). The fame of the
monks of Sinai as rain-makers was noted by Robinson and by
Prof. Palmer.<a name="FNanchor_227_227" id="FNanchor_227_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a> Paulus himself was devoted to various saints,
among whom was the martyr Aekatherina; the thought of
her filled him with joy, and gave him a special power. One
day the monks were sitting down to a meal in the open air when
a rain cloud came up. Paulus bade them remain seated, and
not a drop of rain fell until they had finished their meal, when
it poured.</p>

<p>Direct information on St. Katherine, in this case called
Aekatherina, stands in the <i>Menology of Basileus</i> which is
dated between 957-1027. It stated that the saint dwelt
at Alexandria, and was the daughter of a wealthy king.
She was dignified in appearance and learned in Greek letters,
philosophy, and language. After witnessing a festival of the
Greeks, she approached the emperor Maximianus (<span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 307)
and blamed him for ignoring the living God and adoring lifeless
idols. The emperor summoned fifty learned men to meet
her in argument, threatening them with death if they failed
to confound her. But the learned men were convinced by
the lady and accepted baptism, whereupon they were put to
death. Aekatherina was beheaded.<a name="FNanchor_228_228" id="FNanchor_228_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a></p>

<p>A detailed account of the martyrdom was written by
Simeon Metaphrastes († <i>c.</i> 956), with discussions between the
learned men and the lady, and with further incidents including
the conversion of the general, Porphyrios; the interest which
the Augusta took in Katherine; the fashioning of spiked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
wheels for torturing the saint, which broke of their own accord;
the flow of milk instead of blood when she was beheaded,
a proof of her virginity; and the taking up of the body of
the saint after death by angels who carried her to Mount
Sinai.<a name="FNanchor_229_229" id="FNanchor_229_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a></p>

<p>On turning to the writers who lived about the time alleged,
we find that Emperor Maximianus, as recorded by Eusebius
(<i>c.</i> 320), actually visited Alexandria, where he seized high-born
women for adulterous purposes. Among them was a
most distinguished and illustrious lady who overcame his
intemperate and passionate soul. “Honourable on account
of wealth and parentage, she esteemed all things inferior to
chastity, and the emperor, who could not bring himself to
put her to death, punished her with exile and confiscated her
property.”<a name="FNanchor_230_230" id="FNanchor_230_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a> Eusebius did not mention the lady’s name,
but the details of his story fit the legend and may underlie it.</p>

<p>The name Aekatherina (<i>i.e.</i> the pure one) was rendered in
Latin as Katherina or Catherina. Her association with Sinai
added the cult of a Christian saint to that of Saleh, Moses and
Mohammad. It was chiefly the veneration of St. Katherine
which brought pilgrims to Sinai during the Middle Ages.
According to Giustiniani certain knights, as early as 1063,
banded together in a semi-religious order to guarantee safe
conduct to these pilgrims in Sinai, in the same way as the
Knights of the Holy Sepulchre protected the pilgrims to
Jerusalem.<a name="FNanchor_231_231" id="FNanchor_231_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a> The date mentioned seems rather early and may
need revision.</p>

<p>A great impetus was given to the cult of St. Katherine in
Europe by the visit to Rouen of the hermit Simeon about the
year 1026. His journey was described in an account by
Eberwein, abbot of St. Martin’s at Trèves, who knew him,<a name="FNanchor_232_232" id="FNanchor_232_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a>
and in the <i>Translation of the Relics of St. Katherine to Rouen</i>,
which was written soon after the event.<a name="FNanchor_233_233" id="FNanchor_233_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a></p>

<p>From these accounts we learn that Simeon was from Constantinople,
and went to Bethlehem and then to Sinai, where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
he served for several years in the convent before he became a
hermit near the Red Sea. But here he was so much disturbed
by the sailors and others who came for the oil (? petroleum),
that flowed from the rock near his cell, that he removed first
to the summit of Mount Sinai, where the Law was given, a
place deserted because of the restless Arabs, and then to the
convent itself. It was the time of the great famine in Egypt,
(probably that of 1017), but in the convent there was plenty
of food for the brethren and for the Arabs who crowded there
with their wives and children.</p>

<p>From the <i>Chronicle</i> of Hugo of Flavigny (<i>c.</i> 1096) we learn
that it was customary for the monks at the convent to take
turns in ascending the mountain on the sabbath, in order to
celebrate mass at the shrine of St. Katherine and collect the
oil that flowed from the bones.<a name="FNanchor_234_234" id="FNanchor_234_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a> This shows that the body
of the saint at this time lay enshrined on a mountain which
was probably the Gebel Musa itself. For an ancient prayer
contains the words “Lord, who didst give the Law to Moses
on the summit of Mount Sinai, and who, on the same spot,
didst deposit, through thy holy angels, the body of the blessed
Katherine, virgin and martyr.”<a name="FNanchor_235_235" id="FNanchor_235_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a> At a later date we hear
of bodies of saints lying enshrined in the small church that
stood on the summit of the Gebel Musa. The fact that oil
flowed from the bones is told of many saints. Contrary to the
usually accepted belief, the scientific explanation is probably
as follows. The body lay in a coffin of cedar wood or other
wood that is naturally charged with oil. If the heat generated
in the coffin is great, it would cause the oil to ooze and collect
on the bones or any other cold substance, forming into drops.</p>

<p>The monk Simeon was serving his turn at the shrine, and
drawing off the oil that had collected into a glass phial, when
three small (finger) bones of the saint came loose and were
carried down with it. Simeon took charge of them as a
priceless treasure. As an envoy was needed to go to Normandy
to collect the usual alms, he started, carrying the relics with him.
He travelled by way of Egypt, but the Italian galley in which
he sailed was seized by pirates. He escaped by jumping overboard
and eventually reached Antioch, where he fell in with
a band of pilgrims, with whom he journeyed to Normandy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
by way of Belgrad and Rome. In the meantime, Duke
Richard III, duke of Normandy (993-1026), had died, but
an abbey was in course of construction near Rouen, and Simeon
deposited the relics with the abbot Isambert before he left
for Verdun and for Trèves. The relics worked wonders.
Isambert suffered from toothache and was divinely directed
to the oil which brought him relief. Other miraculous cures
followed. And the Abbey of the Trinity near Rouen gained
such renown that it came to be known as the Abbey of St.
Katherine.<a name="FNanchor_236_236" id="FNanchor_236_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a></p>

</div></div>

<p>A wave of enthusiasm for St. Katherine now swept across
Europe. Her name was inscribed on the local Norman
Kalendar,<a name="FNanchor_237_237" id="FNanchor_237_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a> her story was written and re-written in Latin
and in the vernacular, in prose and in verse. A Latin version<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
was the work of Amandus, a pupil of Isambert of Trèves,
and a semi-Saxon version was written during the reign of
Henry II. An early French version of about 1200 was perhaps
the work of a nun. There were a host of others, many of
which are in MS. and await tabulation.<a name="FNanchor_238_238" id="FNanchor_238_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a> All accounts conclude
with the translation of the body to Sinai; the earlier ones
dwell on the oil, a cure for all ills. And the story was not only
read. In 1119 Geoffroy of Gorham came from Paris to
Dunstable and wrote a <i>Ludus de Katerina</i>, which was performed
by his scholars, on which occasion the clothes that had been
borrowed, took fire and were burnt.</p>

<p>Churches and chapels were now built and placed under the
protection of the saint. In 1148 Queen Matilda founded the
hospital and church of St. Katherine near the Tower which
continued till 1825, when it was destroyed to make room for
the docks. In 1229 King Louis of France built a church of
St. Katherine in Paris, which had been vowed by his knights
at the Battle of Bouvines. First the University of Paris,
and then the University of Padua, accepted St. Katherine
as its patron saint, and in the year 1307 the Doge Pietro
Gradenigo founded the <i>Festa dei Dotti</i> in Venice, in honour
of her. The numerous incidents in her story supplied pictorial
art with a new cycle of subjects. The scene of the martyrdom
and translation to Sinai were first represented on small pictures
of a great panel painted by Margaritone d’Arezzo
(1216-93), which is now in the National Gallery.</p>

<p>In Sinai itself the importance of St. Katherine was more
tardily recognised. We look in vain for mention of her in the
account of the <i>Anonymous Pilgrim</i> of the eleventh century,
and in the booklet <i>On the Holy Places</i>, which Fretellus, archdeacon
of Antioch, wrote for the Count of Toulouse about the
year 1130. It is not till the year 1216, when Magister Thietmar
visited Sinai that we hear of the exhibition to a pilgrim
of the relics which had now been translated from the height of
the mountain to the convent church.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<p class="pch">SINAI DURING THE CRUSADES</p>

<p class="drop-cap05">VARIOUS circumstances combined to raise the convent of
Sinai to great prosperity during the early Middle Ages.
On the one side it received regular contributions in money
from Europe; on the other it attracted the attention of the
pilgrims owing to the increasing fame of St. Katherine. Further
it secured the direct protection of the Moslim rulers of Egypt
owing to a development in trade.</p>

<p>When the Arabs conquered Egypt, the desire arose for
a direct communication by water to Arabia, and the fresh-water
canal which connected the Nile with the Red Sea was
cleared. Corn was now shipped on the Nile for Djar, the port
of Medina, where goods coming from India and China were
disembarked and re-shipped for Egypt. But owing to a
dispute between the ruler of Egypt and his uncle at Medina,
in the year 775, the port of Djar was closed to the Egyptians.
The ships bearing Eastern goods for Egypt for a time landed at
Roman Clysma, near Suez, which secured a new lease of life as
Arabic Kolzoum. But Kolzoum like Arsinoë, silted up,
while Suez as a port was not yet in being. On the west
coast of the peninsula of Sinai lay Raithou, near which a
landing stage offered the advantages of a natural harbour.
Ships therefore landed near Raithou, called Raya by the Arabs,
where the goods were transferred to camel-back for conveyance
to Cairo and Alexandria.</p>

<p>The monks of the convent of Sinai were in direct connection
with the monks at Raithou, who owned large palm
groves, and doubtless controlled the landing stage. For the
place which here grew up came to be known as Tur, an Arabic
word signifying height, which was first applied to the convent
of Sinai. Mukaddisi (<i>c.</i> 985) mentioned Tur Sina and noted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
that the Christians had a convent there, and some well-cultivated
fields, and olive trees of great excellence.<a name="FNanchor_239_239" id="FNanchor_239_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a> The
Christians called it Porta Santa Katerina or simply Santa
Katerina (1383). The use of Tur as a port brought the Sultan
of Egypt into relation with the monks, and acted as a safeguard
to the convent.</p>

<p>In 1010 the Saracens bore down on the Church of the Holy
Sepulchre at Jerusalem and destroyed it. They then moved
on to Sinai with the intention of destroying the convent also,
but they were warned off by seeing the mountain aglow with
fire. The chronicler, Ademar, stated that when the report
of the proposed attack reached the Sultan, he and his Saracens
repented.<a name="FNanchor_240_240" id="FNanchor_240_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a> An attack on the port of Aila may have caused
a further deviation of trade to Tur. Makrizi († 1441) recorded
that Aila was pillaged by Abd Allah ben Edirs ben Dgofair,
governor of El Korah, with the help of the Benu el Garrah.<a name="FNanchor_241_241" id="FNanchor_241_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a>
This put a stop to the transit of goods via Aila to Damascus,
and the Eastern goods for Syria as well as those for Egypt were
now disembarked at Tur. This change is reflected in the fact
that Tur, sometime between 1020 and 1050 took the place of
Kolzoum as a customs station, although it remained for some
time so poor a place that the appointment there was considered
equal to a disgrace.</p>

<p>The rule of the Moslim until now had brought endless
burdens and oppression to the Christians in Egypt. The
churches had been robbed, the convents had been mulcted
and their inmates had been disgraced by the emir who acted
for the Sultan. But a change now took place. Bononius,
a Benedictine monk from Bologne, came to Cairo in 1025,
having obtained an interview with the Sultan to request that
the Christian prisoners should be set at liberty. Bononius
also visited Sinai and Jerusalem.<a name="FNanchor_242_242" id="FNanchor_242_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a> In 1045 the patriarch
who had hitherto dwelt at Alexandria, removed to Cairo, and
we now hear, in the sparse annals of the convent, of direct
relations between the monks and the Sultan.</p>

<p>In the year 1069 John the Athenian, bishop of Sinai, was
killed during his stay in Egypt under circumstances that are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
not recorded. He was canonised at the convent. In the
year 1103 the bishop Zacharias was mentioned in a <i>firmân</i>
(εἰς ἕνα ὁρισμόν) of Emir Elmoumne, a term explained as
<i>imperator fidelium</i>; perhaps it was Amir Abu Mansur (1101-1130).
The next bishop, George, was also recognised by the
Sultan in 1133. His successor at the convent named Gabriel,
who was mentioned in 1146, was learned in Arabic, and wrote
sermons as is shown by an Arabic book in the convent. He
was in touch with the Sultan “Kaim Impnes Rhaila,” who was
perhaps Zafir Abu el Mansur Ismael (1149-1151). The next
prelate was John, whose date is fixed at 1164 by an Arabic
letter which he addressed to the monks at Raithou. The
next bishop was Simeon.<a name="FNanchor_243_243" id="FNanchor_243_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a></p>

     <div class="caption"><p class="pc">Fig. 18.&mdash;El Arish. (<i>Times History of the War.</i>)</p>
</div></div>

<p>Of the religious life of the cities along the Mediterranean
coast little is known at this period. The last bishop of Ostracine
known by name was Abraham, of the year 431. At
Rhinocorura called El Arish by the Moslim, later bishops
were Ptolemæus and Gregorius. Lequien made the mistake
of identifying Rhinocorura with Farma, and mentioned the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
Jacobite prelates of Farma as prelates of Rhinocorura.
Farma, famous for its palm groves, was near the ruins of
the ancient Pelusium. El Arish continued an important
city under Moslim rule, but its architectural features were
not respected. Abu Saleh, the Armenian, who wrote an
account of the churches and monasteries of Egypt about the
year 1071, mentioned El Arish or Rhinocorura. “In this
region there are two large churches which have stood from
ancient times and are now in ruins, but their walls remain up
to our time; and the wall of the city which ran along the
side of the Salt Sea, is still existing. It is said that of all the
marble and columns which are to be found at Misr (<i>i.e.</i> Cairo)
the greater part and the largest specimens came from El
Arish.”<a name="FNanchor_244_244" id="FNanchor_244_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a> (<a href="#i145">Fig. 18</a>.)</p>

<p>The connection of the monks and the Sultan attracted
the attention of Arab writers to the convent. Edrizi (<i>c.</i>
1153), Ibn Zobeir (<i>c</i>. 1183), mentioned its existence in general
terms. Benjamin of Tudela, the Jewish rabbi who acted for
a time as vizier to Adid († 1171), the last of the Fatimite rulers,
held that it was occupied by Syrian monks, who were subject
to the Sultan. He also remarked that at the foot of the
mountain lay Tur Sina, a large town, the inhabitants of
which spoke the language of the Targum (<i>i.e.</i> Syriac). It
was close to a small mountain and five days’ journey from
Egypt.<a name="FNanchor_245_245" id="FNanchor_245_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a></p>

<p>The trade via Tur naturally brought the monks into
contact with the Further East. Fretellus of Antioch (<i>c.</i> 1130)
declared that the monks of Sinai, “from the confines of
Ethiopia to the utmost bounds of the Persians, were venerated
in every tongue, possessing their property freely and quietly
among themselves. They had cells throughout Egypt and
Persia, around the Red Sea and Arabia, from which all they
required flowed most liberally.”<a name="FNanchor_246_246" id="FNanchor_246_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a> In addition to this, grants
were made to them by the Crusaders in the lands which they
conquered.</p>

<p>The Pope, from the first, had favoured the Crusades as a
means of extending the influence of Latin Christianity.
When Jerusalem was conquered in 1099, the Greek patriarch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
happened to be absent. He was passed over and a Latin
patriarch was appointed in his stead. The authority of
this prelate was extended with the advance of the Crusaders.
Godfrey was proclaimed king of Jerusalem in 1099. He
was succeeded by Baldwin, who, in 1115, made an expedition
to “Mount Oreb, commonly called Orel,” <i>i.e.</i> Mount Hor
near Petra, the present Gebel Haroun. “Starting from here,
Baldwin overcame the desert places and vast solitudes by
conveying a quantity of food on mules, and reached Aila,
which he found deserted, and of which he took possession.
Here he heard of the monks, who dwelt in Sinai, and served
God, and he desired to go to them across the mountain in
order to pray. But he was prevented by a message from the
monks who feared that their Moslim master might be annoyed
by the king’s visit, so he gave up the idea.”<a name="FNanchor_247_247" id="FNanchor_247_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a> He turned
back, and on his way to Syria he conquered Petra, near which
he erected the fortress of Monreale. He then moved along the
shores of the Mediterranean as far as Farma, where he died in
1117. According to Makrizi he burnt down the mosque and
perished in its flames. Roger of Sicily in 1155 completed the
work of destruction by a descent on Farma, which he set on
fire and pillaged.</p>

<p>When Baldwin, disappointed of his visit to Sinai, seized
Petra, this became a Latin bishopric, and the Latin patriarch
of Jerusalem eventually had under him four bishops, of Tyre,
Cæsarea, Nazareth, and Petra.<a name="FNanchor_248_248" id="FNanchor_248_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a> The name of the Latin
bishop of Petra is not preserved.<a name="FNanchor_249_249" id="FNanchor_249_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a> According to Jacques of
Vitry († 1244) the bishop of Petra had one suffragan, <i>i.e.</i>
“the bishop of Sinai, superior to the convent of St. Katherine
the Virgin, and the monks of that convent.”<a name="FNanchor_250_250" id="FNanchor_250_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a> In Sinai
itself no record of a Latin prelate was preserved. But irregularities
in the succession suggest that the Latin bishop of
Sinai was Simeon, who advocated the cause of the monks with
the Pope.</p>

<p>On the other side of the peninsula, the appropriation of
Aila by the Crusaders called for interference. Saladdin, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
1170, had a fleet built, with which he sailed around the
peninsula, and attacked and retook Aila. But the enterprising
Renaud de Chatillon (the Alaïris of Makrizi) collected material
for ships on the Dead Sea, conveyed them to the Gulf of
Akaba on camel-back, and seized Aila from where he pillaged
the coast, and made piratical descents on the shipping for over
a year. The small island, Iotabe, later Emrag, the present
Zigiret el Faraun, lies at a short distance from Aila. It has
no harbour, but is almost entirely built over by a castle with
squared towers in the mediæval style. The work was
probably begun in Roman times, but was added to by Renaud
de Chatillon. But in 1184 Melek el Adel (Abu Bakr, 1199-1218),
the brother of Saladdin (1171-1193), came with a fleet
to Aila and attacked and finally routed the Franks. Advancing
across the country he re-conquered Petra, which henceforth
remained under Moslim rule.</p>

<p>In the meantime the monks were profiting by the good
graces of neighbouring prelates. In 1203 the archbishop
of Crete, described as “a lover of St. Katherine, the Virgin,”
bestowed on the monks of Sinai property in Crete which
represented an annual income of four hundred ducats,<a name="FNanchor_251_251" id="FNanchor_251_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a>
whereupon Simeon, bishop of Sinai went into Crete, where he
built a priory (μετόχιον). In 1204 the Venetians acquired the
whole island of Crete by purchase from Boniface, marquis
of Montferrat, and Simeon went to Venice where losses
incurred by the monks, were made good to him.<a name="FNanchor_252_252" id="FNanchor_252_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a> A letter
is extant of the Doge Pietro Ziani of 1211, in which he confirmed
the ruler of Mount Sinai in the possessions which he held in
Crete. It describes the ruler as “archbishop,” which seems
to be the earliest use of this title. Crete remained in the
power of the city of Venice till 1645, and letters are extant
from successive doges which confirm the rights held by the
monks in the island.<a name="FNanchor_253_253" id="FNanchor_253_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a></p>

<p>From Venice Simeon probably went to Rome, where a
general synod was convened by Pope Innocent III (1198-1216)
in 1211. Its purpose was to discuss the state of the
Holy Land, “where the son of the bondswoman (<i>i.e.</i> Hagar),

Simeon, “bishop of Sinai,” is among the MSS. of the Vatican.<a name="FNanchor_255_255" id="FNanchor_255_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a>
In the <i>Regesta</i> of Pope Honorius III (1216-27) we come across
repeated mention of Simeon, bishop of Sinai. A grant of 1217
gave the protection of St. Peter to the Monastery of the Virgin
at the foot of the mountain and to its possessions; another
confirmed the bishop of Sinai and his chapter in those possessions
which they held at the time of the great synod (of 1211)
or had acquired since; others advised the bishop of Crete to
respect the monks and hold them exempt from paying tithes
on the property which they held in Crete.<a name="FNanchor_256_256" id="FNanchor_256_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a> In the year 1226
Pope Honorius granted a bull to Simeon and the monks of
Sinai, “of the order of St. Basil.” It is difficult to procure
the text; its wording was probably much the same as that
of a bull granted in confirmation of it by Pope Gregory IX
(1221-41), of which a copy was preserved at the convent.
This bull enumerated the possessions which the convent held
in those countries over which the Pope claimed authority
by virtue of the conquests made by the Crusaders.</p>

have not been identified. Mention was then made of Rayton
(<i>i.e.</i> Raithou), with its palm groves and property; of houses
and property near the city of Egypt (<i>i.e.</i> Cairo); land on the
Red Sea; property and palm groves in Faran; rights (<i>obedientia</i>)
in the church of St. Michael in Alexandria, and liberty
of transit by land and water; vineyards and olive groves in
the valley of Moses (<i>i.e.</i> near Petra); in Monreale, houses, a
mill, vineyards and olive groves; property in Croce (not
identified); in Jerusalem, rights in the church of St. Michael,
houses and a bakehouse; in Jaffa, houses and land; near
Acre, houses and the church of St. Katherine; in Laodichea
(near the sources of the Orontes), the hospital of St. Demetrios
and a house; in Damascus, the church of St. George,
houses and property; at Odaverosa (not identified), houses,
land and vineyards; near Antioch, a house and a bakehouse;
near Constantinople, rights in the church of St. George of
Mangana; in Crete, extensive property, including several
churches with land pertaining thereto, several mills, vineyards,
etc.; in the island of Cyprus, houses, vineyards, woods,
rights of pasture and of trading.</p>

<p>Simeon, who secured the Papal recognition to these rights,
was bishop of Sinai from 1203 to 1253, according to Gregoriades.
But the list of bishops which was compiled at the convent
by Nectarius named Euthymius in 1223; Macarius (I)
in 1224; Germanus in 1228; Theodosius in 1239; and
Macarius (II) in 1248, who was named also in an ancient
Arabic MS.<a name="FNanchor_258_258" id="FNanchor_258_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a> In the year 1258 the ruler was again Simeon.
Some writers hold that this was the same Simeon who went
to Europe, and possibly he was the suffragan of the Catholic
bishop of Petra. The statements regarding him are difficult
to reconcile. According to Gregoriades, the monks of Sinai,
owing to the liberality of the Crusaders, owned property also
in Tripoli and Gaza, and the produce of these places and that
of Damascus was so plentiful as almost to supply their entire
needs.</p>

<p>In the year 1216 a truce was concluded between the Sultan
of Egypt and the Christians, which restored freedom of
movement to the pilgrims. Magister Thietmar,<a name="FNanchor_259_259" id="FNanchor_259_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a> who was in
the Holy Land, availed himself of it “to carry out his fervent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
wish to visit the body of the blessed St. Katherine which
exuded the sacred oil” (c. 8). In order to do so with impunity
he adopted the appearance of a Georgian monk (c. 28), and
journeyed by way of Mount Abarim, where Moses died,
Mount Neb, Mount Phasga (Pisgah) and Mount Phagor in
the land of the Moabites and Midian. By way of Roba
he reached Crach and Petra, in Gallic Monreal, in Saracenic
Scobach, where there was a great fortress that belonged
to the Sultan of Babylon, and where Christians and Saracens
dwelt in the suburbs. Here a Gallic widow gave him advice
and provided him with food, and the Boidiwinos (Bedawyn)
undertook to take him to Mount Sinai along a road that was
known to none but themselves and to bring him back dead
or alive. Leaving Kadesh Barnea on the right, he crossed
the desert of Pharan, and reached the Red Sea and a fort
(Aila), where captive Franks, English and Latins lived on
fishing (c. 17). Three days later he reached Mount Sinai,
“which the Saracens called Tur Sin.” He was much impressed
by the church of the Virgin which was resplendent with
marble, and roofed with lead, and contained many hanging
lamps. The monks were Greeks and Syrians, and their food
included fish which was brought from the Red Sea and many
things from Babylon (Cairo). The original Bush of Moses
being no longer in existence, a golden bush (<i>aureus rubus</i>),
hung with golden images of the Lord and of Moses, had taken
its place. Small stones, engraved with a bush, were cut or dug
up (<i>effodiantur</i>) which served against all infirmities. When
the Sultan (probably Melek el Adel, 1199-1218) came there,
he took off his shoes before entering the chapel (c. 20).</p>

<p>In the convent church stood the tomb of St. Katherine, a
small chest of white marble. The bishop, hearing of the
arrival of Thietmar and his wish to see the relics, approached
the chest with prayer and incense, and had the cover removed.
Thietmar saw the relics of St. Katherine and kissed her bared
head. The limbs still hung together and were steeped in oil,
which “exuded from the bones, not from the sarcophagus,
like drops of sweat.”</p>

<p>“When I inquired about her translation from the mountain
to the church,” wrote Thietmar, “I was told that a certain
hermit who dwelt in another part of Mount Sinai from that
on which the body of St. Katherine was laid by the angels,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
frequently saw, by day and by night, a light of great brightness
in or near the place where the body lay. Wondering what it
was, he went to the church at the foot of the mountain, and
described the sight that he saw and the place where he saw it.
The monks, after fasting, ascended the mountain, in a procession
that was led by him. When they found the body,
they greatly wondered whose it was, whence it had come, and
how it was taken there. As they stood there wondering, an
aged hermit from Alexandria declared, like Habakkuk the
prophet who spoke to Daniel, that the body had been brought
to Sinai by the grace of God, and he assured those who doubted,
that it was the body of the blessed Katherine, and had been
carried there by angels. At his instigation, the bishop and
the monks translated the body to the church because the
place where it lay was quite inaccessible (c. 19).</p>

<p>Thietmar then asked to be taken to the height on Mount
Sinai, where Moses received the Law, and on his way thither
he saw the chapel where the Virgin met the monks who, on
account of the lack of food, and the verminous condition of
the convent, were about to leave, but she bade them turn
back (c. 22). He also saw the spot where the Virgin promised
the monks a plentiful supply of oil for their lamps; likewise
the chapel of Elijah on Horeb; the imprint on the rock of
the body of Moses; and the place where the body of St.
Katherine was laid by the angels (c. 23). Before leaving the
convent he received some of the precious oil (c. 27). His home
and the place to which he went are unknown. An account of
the Moslim faith which he added to his narrative, reflects a
liberal spirit, and, taken together with his Latinity, indicates
a man of learning and understanding.</p>

<p>The call of Pope Innocent III, in 1211, stirred up anew the
spirit of the Crusaders, but efforts were now directed, in the
first place, against the Sultan in Egypt. Damietta, which lay
on the Tanitic mouth of the Nile, where the Moslim had
a fort, was the scene of many struggles. From January, 1218,
to November, 1219, it was occupied by the Franks. In the
meantime, the emperor Frederick invaded Palestine on his own
account, and in 1229 secured a truce by which the Christian
pilgrims were once more enabled to travel to Jerusalem. The
advantages which he received were forfeited, however, owing
to quarrels among the Christians themselves. The Sultan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
marched on Gaza in 1244, and attacked Jerusalem, which was
finally lost to the Christians. It was in vain that the French
king Louis IX, in 1249, occupied Damietta and pillaged
Ostracine, which altogether disappeared. But Louis was taken
prisoner and the restoration of Damietta was part of his
ransom. Changes among the Moslim rulers hurried on events.
The Mongols, pressing in from the East, overthrew the Caliph
of Baghdad and destroyed the Syrian kingdom. A descendant
of the true Prophet was established on the throne of Egypt
as a nominal ruler, while the general, Bibars († 1277), with the
title of Sultan, extended his authority over the greater part
of Arabia and Syria. Bibars successfully led the campaign
against the Crusaders. Antioch fell in 1268, Tripoli in 1289,
Acre in 1291. By these losses the spirit of the Crusaders was
broken.</p>

<p>Of the bishops of Sinai during this period, little is known.
In succession to Simeon (I or II), John III ruled from 1265
to 1290, and was followed by Arsinius, who was a book lover.
Several books in Greek which are now in the convent library
were written at his instigation, and one of them was owned by
him.<a name="FNanchor_260_260" id="FNanchor_260_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a> The next bishop was Simeon (II or III), who ruled from
1306 to 1324, and was followed by Dorotheus (1324-1333), who
secured a <i>firmân</i> from the Sultan,<a name="FNanchor_261_261" id="FNanchor_261_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a> and a bull from Pope
John XXII, who was at Avignon at the time. In this bull,
dated 1328, the pope called upon Hugh, king of Cyprus, to
respect the rights which former kings of Cyprus had granted
to the monks of Sinai. He also recognised their right of burial
in the church of St. Simeon at Famagusta in Cyprus, and
granted one year’s indulgence to pilgrims who visited the
shrine of St. Katherine in Mount Sinai.</p>

<p>It was presumably Bishop Dorotheus who received Duke
Henry II of Brunswick in Sinai in 1330, who came bearing
a letter from the Greek emperor to his “dear relatives,” the
Greek prelates. According to the German record, the
“archbishop of Sinai” received the duke in person, and
bestowed on him, among other relics, a thorn from the crown
of Christ, which he had himself received from the king of
France to whom he was sent as envoy. Duke Henry received
also oil, and perhaps a bone, from the shrine of St. Katherine,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
which, together with the thorn, he deposited in the church of
the monastery of Walkenried after his return to Germany.<a name="FNanchor_262_262" id="FNanchor_262_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a></p>

<p>The ruler in succession to Dorotheus was Germanus III,
and he was followed by Marcus who is named in an Arabic
MS., and went to Rome in 1376 to collect alms for his
convent. It was probably owing to his influence that a bull
had been granted to the monks by Pope Innocent VI in 1360.<a name="FNanchor_263_263" id="FNanchor_263_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a></p>

<p>Later bishops included Job, whose name appears in an
inscription in the convent church, and the following, who
were named in a Arabic MS. without record of their date:
Athanasius (I); Sabbas; Abraham; Gabriel (II); Michael;
Silvanus; Cyrillus. Mention is also made of one Solomon,
whose name is not otherwise recorded.</p>

<p class="pch">THE PILGRIMS OF THE MIDDLE AGES I.</p>

<p class="drop-cap06">A KEEN interest in the Near East was aroused in Europe by
the Crusades. At their conclusion travellers of every
kind, more especially pilgrims and merchants, started for
Palestine and Sinai, eager to visit the holy places, and to see
some of the marvels of which the Crusaders had brought
back accounts to their homes. The movement was for a time
hindered by the difficulties which were raised by the Sultan,
who suspected a further alliance between the “Franks” and
the Tartars. But the princes of Europe interfered on behalf
of the pilgrims, and Sultan Melik el Nasir, who ruled with
some interruptions from 1293 to 1341, was a man of wider
outlook, who entered into diplomatic relations with the Pope,
the king of Aragon, and the king of France. He did his
utmost to protect the pilgrims. Crowds of them now started
for the Holy Land, a certain number extending their voyage
to the shrine of St. Katherine in Sinai, a visit to which formed
part of the so-called Long Pilgrimage.</p>

<p>The flow of pilgrims was naturally influenced by the
social and political events of the day. Of those who took
the Long Pilgrimage, six,<a name="FNanchor_264_264" id="FNanchor_264_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a> between the years 1331 and 1346,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
wrote an account of their journey, and made mention of
Sinai. After this there was a break, no doubt attributable to
the Black Death which swept across Europe in 1348-49, and
to the war which Peter, king of Cyprus, waged on Egypt,
which led to the sack of Alexandria in 1365. Towards the
close of the century pilgrims again became numerous, and six
further accounts between the years 1384 and 1397 describe
a visit to St. Katherine.<a name="FNanchor_265_265" id="FNanchor_265_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a> Again, during the first half of the
fifteenth century visitors to St. Katherine were relatively
few, whereas large parties of pilgrims sought the convent
between 1460 and 1497, several members of the same party
sometimes writing a description of their journey.</p>

<p>The pilgrims, for the most part, sailed from a port in Italy,
more especially from Genoa or Venice, in galleys, which were
timed to meet the caravans which brought the produce of
the East to Alexandria and Jaffa. From Alexandria they went
to Babylon (Cairo), where they procured a <i>firmân</i> from the
Sultan which established their peaceful intentions in the eyes
of the Bedawyn (Baldensel, p. 343; Frescobaldo, 1384, p. 99,
etc.). Or they went to Jaffa and Jerusalem where those who
wished to extend their pilgrimage to Sinai proceeded on
mule-back to Gaza, where camels were chartered for crossing
the desert. Travel was facilitated at the time by the
permanent foothold which the Franciscans, following in the
wake of St. Francis himself (1226), had secured at Jerusalem
and at Gaza, and by the establishment, in various cities, of
consuls whose chief duty it was to befriend and protect the
pilgrims. The cities of Florence, Venice, Genoa, and the
Catalans each had a consul in Alexandria in 1384 (Frescobaldo,
p. 72). Venice had a consul in Jaffa in 1413, and one
in Jerusalem in 1415.<a name="FNanchor_266_266" id="FNanchor_266_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a> There was a house or hostel set
apart for the use of pilgrims in Cairo in 1384 (Sigoli, p. 16),
where food was given to poor pilgrims who were on their way
to St. Katherine (Martone, p. 596).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>Among the earlier accounts was that of the friar Antoninus
of Cremona, who set out from Cairo to Sinai with seven Latin
pilgrims in 1331, going on to Jerusalem by way of Gaza.
The wish to visit the shrine of St. Katherine was aroused in
him by paintings, representing her story, which were a gift to
his city by a merchant of Piacenza (p. 170). Again, there was
the Italian notary, Jacopo of Verona, who, after a stay in the
Holy Land in 1335, proceeded to Gaza, which he left on
August 28, arriving at the convent on September 10. Jacopo
mentioned as stopping places between Gaza and the convent,
Nocale (Kala’at en Nakhl) “in our language called Phurfur”
(? bran), and Colebmaleo. At Nocale at the Fountain of the
Sultan (<i>Puteus Soldani</i>) he met over twelve thousand pilgrims
with six thousand camels, who were on their way back from
Mecca, and who moved in bands according to the countries
to which they belonged, an arrangement which greatly impressed
Jacopo (p. 228). At the <i>Puteus Soldani</i> the Seigneur
d’Anglure who was on his way from Gaza to the convent in
October of 1395, met ten thousand Moslim pilgrims (p. 45).</p>

<p>Another pilgrim, Wilhelm de Baldensel, in the summer of
1336, rode on horseback from Cairo to the convent in ten days,
much to the surprise of the monks. From here he went on
to Jerusalem (p. 344). Again, Ludolf of Sudheim, during the
thirteen years which he spent travelling in the East visited the
convent some time between 1336 and 1341, and Sir John
Maundeville was there some time in the course of his twenty-five
years of travel. These pilgrims, like Thietmar, in 1216
found the relics of St. Katherine enshrined in a marble chest
or sarcophagus which stood in the convent church, and were
allowed to see them after they had been the usual round of
the sights (Ludolf, p. 840).</p>

<p>The relics of St. Katherine consisted of the head and some
of the limbs. Jacopo stated that, besides these, the monks
had bones stored away in another chest or <i>arca</i> (p. 230).
Maundeville writes he saw “the head of St. Katherine rolled in
a bleeding cloth, and many other holy and venerable relics,
which I looked at carefully and often with unworthy eyes”
(p. 60). Wilhelm de Baldensel first noted a silver scoop or
spoon which was used for taking up the drops of oil which
exuded “not from the sarcophagus, but from the bones”
(p. 344), and which was given in small glass phials to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
pilgrims (Jacopo, p. 230). This use of a scoop shows that the
oil flowed less plentifully than at the time when the chest that
contained the bones stood on the height, where it was “drawn
off” by Simeon.</p>

<p>The view was now held that the body of the saint was
originally laid by the angels, “not on the Mount of the Law,
but on the Mount of St. Katherine,” as we learn from Antoninus.
Here the impress made by the body on the stone was
shown, which induced the pilgrims to make the ascent of the
Gebel Katrîn. The impress of the body was seen also by
Rudolf von Fraymansperg, who visited Sinai in 1346 (p. 359), by
Simone Sigoli in 1384 (p. 84), and by others. According to
different accounts, the body lay exposed on the height two or
three or four or five hundred years before it was brought to
the convent.</p>

<p>Other legends are related by the pilgrims. Antoninus
stated that about a hundred “ravens” were fed every day
at the convent kitchen in memory of Elijah, who was fed by
ravens (p. 167). Sir John Maundeville improved on this
statement by relating that “all ravens, choughs and crows
of the district flew once a year in pilgrimage to the convent
bearing a branch of bay or olive” (p. 59). In connection
with these legends, both the story of Elijah, and the “ravens”
that flocked to the convent, it is well to bear in mind that
the words for raven and Arab sound alike in Arabic.</p>

<p>Many hanging lamps were now kept burning in the convent
church, the number of which Jacopo estimated as three
hundred. Sir John held that they indicated the presence of
as many monks, and he added that when the prelate of the
abbey died, his lamp went out and lit again of its own accord,
if his successor were worthy (p. 60).</p>

<p>On the Mount of the Law stood the small church which
at one time contained the relics of St. Katherine, and which
continued to contain bodies of saints as late as 1384. Near
it was the cavern in which Moses stood when the Lord passed
(Sigoli, p. 82; Maundeville, p. 62). Beyond it was the small
mosque which the Saracens sought in pilgrimage, and which
to Antoninus was “an idol of abomination” (p. 168).</p>

<div class="figcenter">

         title="" />
     <div class="caption"><p class="pc">Fig. 20.&mdash;Sketch of convent surroundings about 1335.</p>
</div></div>

<p>The relative position of these buildings and sites is shown
on the topographical sketch made by Jacopo, which is here
reproduced (<a href="#i159">Fig. 20</a>). On it we note the convent church with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a><br /><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
its tower, and we are told that inside the convent walls there
“stood likewise a mosque with a tower of its own, from which
the <i>cazes</i>, or priest of the Saracens, proclaimed the Mohammedan
faith, a proceeding to which the <i>kalogeri</i> or monks could raise
no objection, since they were under the dominion of the
Sultan who would have it so” (<i>c.</i> 1335, p. 321). This mosque
of the <i>maladetta fede</i> was noticed also by the party of
distinguished Italians who came to Sinai from Cairo in 1384.
These included Leonardo dei Niccoli Frescobaldo from Florence,
Simone Sigoli from Venice, and a certain Giorgio di Messer
Gucci di Dino, each of whom was attended by his serving
man.</p>

<p>The sketch of Jacopo further shows the path leading up
from the convent to the Mount of the Law “where the law
was given to Moses,” with the chapel “where the Blessed
Mary appeared;” the church of St. Elijah; and the mosque of
the Saracens. There is also a garden with a fountain, and
a zigzag path leading up to a higher mountain where “lay the
body of the Blessed Katherine.” From the summit of this
mountain Jacopo saw the Red Sea, and watched the ships that
carried pepper, ginger, cinnamon, and other spicery from
India. He also went the two days’ journey to Tur, which
he called Elim, where he bathed in the Red Sea. Here he
saw the place where the Israelites came out of the water,
and remains of the Pharaoh, apparently bones, lying on the
sea shore. In the belief that this was Elim of the Bible, he
noticed that there were here, not seventy palm trees as stated,
but ten thousand date palms, the produce of which the
monks sold at a high price at Cairo (p. 237). From an Arabic
source we hear that special attention was given to Tur in the
year 1378, by Salah ed Din Ibn Gourram, grand vizier of
Egypt.<a name="FNanchor_267_267" id="FNanchor_267_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a></p>

<p>The number of pilgrims from Europe who visited Sinai is
difficult to estimate. The guide who was engaged to conduct
the Italians from Cairo to the convent in 1384, had taken
pilgrims along this route seventy-six times (Sigoli, p. 15).
The knights who wished to be enrolled as Knights of the
Order of St. Katherine, hung up their arms in the convent
church (Tafur: “<i>dexe mis armis</i>”), and received a badge
which showed a broken wheel that was pierced by a sword.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
Some pilgrims noted the names and scutcheons of earlier
ones, which, together with coats of arms, were scratched on
the wall spaces.</p>

<p>The zeal of the pilgrims was responsible for further developments
in the story of St. Katherine. Ludolf of Sudheim in
1341 sought the spot outside Alexandria where the saint was
beheaded (p. 827); the Italians of 1384 identified the prison
in which she was confined, the columns on which were placed
the spiked wheels that broke of their own accord, and her
dwelling place “where now stands the palace of the lamelech,”
<i>i.e.</i> the emir of the Sultan (Sigoli, p. 90; Frescobaldo, p. 82).
The columns which were of red porphyry were noticed also by
Thomas of Swynburne, an Englishman and mayor of Bordeaux
at the time, who paid a hurried visit to Egypt and
Sinai in 1392, of which his companion, Briggs, wrote a short
account.</p>

<p>And more than this. The oldest account of Katherine
claimed for her royal descent. The <i>Speculum</i> of Vincent of
Beauvais (<i>c.</i> 1190-1264) gave her father’s name as Costus.
Another line of tradition called him Constantius and made
him into a king of Cyprus, where the monks of Sinai had
possessions in the year 1216. A chapel dedicated to St. Katherine
situated near “Salamina” or Constantia in Cyprus, was
visited by Ludolf in 1341 (p. 826). In the year 1394 Niccolo
de Martone, the Italian notary from Carniola, whose desire
“to reach the dominion of the blessed Virgin in Sinai” took
him to the East, went from Famagusta in Cyprus to Constantia,
which in his estimation was built by Constantius, the father
of St. Katherine. Here he saw the palace and the chamber,
“now in ruins,” where St. Katherine dwelt, and near it her
chapel, which many persons sought in pilgrimage (p. 632).
From Famagusta he visited an island to which St. Katherine
went at the suggestion of her mother, in order to consult a
hermit regarding her marriage. His advice was that she should
wed Christ, and in the night an angel appeared, who gave
her a ring (p. 633). This is the first we hear of the mystic
marriage of St. Katherine, which henceforth formed an incident
in her legend and was further developed. The <i>History of
St. Katherine</i>, which was written by the Augustinian monk
Capgrave about the year 1430, described how a hermit named
Adrian was sent to Alexandria by the Queen of Heaven. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
took the maid into the desert where Christ appeared to her
in a dream and gave her a ring.<a name="FNanchor_268_268" id="FNanchor_268_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a> This incident does not
appear in the story of St. Katherine as told in the <i>Legenda
Aurea</i> of Jacopo of Voragine, which was written about the
year 1255. But the English version of the <i>Golden Legend</i>,
which was printed by the Caxton Press about the year 1483,
described the gift of an actual ring, further developing the
story. For according to this account Costus, king of Cyprus
and the father of the saint, was the son of Constantius, king
of Armenia, whose second wife was Helena, the daughter of
King Cole of Britain, and the mother of the emperor Constantine.
Thus St. Katherine was linked up with the kings
of Britain on the one side, and with the emperors of Rome on
the other!</p>

<p>In the convent of Sinai no attention was given to these
developments, and the <i>Life of St. Katherine</i> that was read in
the convent confined itself to the facts related by Simeon
Metaphrastes.</p>

<p>The convent reached the high-water mark of its prosperity
during the fourteenth century. It drew a large income from
its outlying possessions, it received gifts from the Sultan
and from the pilgrims, it levied tribute on the goods that were
unshipped at Tur. The basis of this arrangement is not
directly stated, but the writer Piloti, about the year 1440,
declared that the tax levied on the goods at Tur was 10 per
cent. of their value,<a name="FNanchor_269_269" id="FNanchor_269_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a> and the Ritter von Harff, about the
year 1497, held that the monks went shares with the Sultan
in the profit made on the goods.<a name="FNanchor_270_270" id="FNanchor_270_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a></p>

<p>The Italians who visited the convent in 1384 found two
hundred monks in residence, of whom one hundred and fifty
served the convent chapels, and fifty the chapels on the
Mount of the Law. There were besides a very large number
of Moslim, who dwelt inside the convent precincts (Frescobaldo,
p. 121).</p>

<p>Food was cooked in the convent kitchen every day for
four hundred persons, in huge cauldrons that came from
Venice, and were conveyed across the desert on camel-back<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
(Frescobaldo, p. 167). Largess was distributed daily to a
thousand Arabs of the desert (<i>Ibid.</i>, p. 121). In the year 1393
the monks and their dependents were two hundred and eighty
in number, and two loaves were given daily to each pilgrim
and to every Arab and mariner, of whom large crowds applied
for food at the convent (Martone, p. 608).</p>

<p>Some of the pilgrims supply information on the Saracens
or Bedawyn, who all through showed an independent spirit.
During the whole of the Mameluk dynasty (1250-1517), they
were complete masters of Suez. Wilhelm de Baldensel,
calling them Ridelbim, stated that they lived on their camels
and goats, neither sowing nor reaping, and eating such bread
as they procured in Syria and Egypt. They were brown,
fleet-footed, and carried a shield and a spear, rode on camels,
wrapped themselves in linen, and acknowledged the authority
of the Sultan, who, however, gave them presents since they
could easily expel him and occupy Syria and Egypt (p. 345).
Antoninus in 1331 also remarked that the Arabs had no
fear of the Sultan (p. 165), and Ludolf held that the Sultan
lavished on them gifts and flattery, since they could easily
subjugate his territory (p. 89).</p>

<p>The attitude of these Bedawyn in matters of religion was
perplexing to the Europeans, who began with looking upon
Mohammad the Prophet as the incarnation of all wickedness,
and then realised that his followers had a standard of dignity
and hospitality which were by no means despicable. Ludolf,
in 1341, noted that the Saracens did homage to St. Katherine
(p. 66), and Frescobaldo remarked that the Saracens held
the mountains of Sinai in veneration. “And be it known,”
he continued, “that the Saracens reverence the Virgin Mary,
St. John the Baptist, St. Katherine, and all the patriarchs of
the Old Testament and hold that Christ was the great prophet
previous to Mohammad; also that Christ was not born of the
flesh, but that the Divine Father, through the lips of an angel,
sent the Divine Word, and that in many ways they approximate
our faith” (pp. 91, 101).</p>

<p>An English poem of about the year 1425 is extant, which
describes the chief sites of pilgrimage at the time. They
included the shrine of St. James of Compostella in Spain,
the city of Rome, Jerusalem, and Mount Sinai. The
poem is about 1500 lines long, of which about thirty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
deal with Mount Sinai, and are as follows (the spelling is
modernised):</p>

<p class="pp6 p1">In that mount up high<br />

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XVI</h2>

<p class="pch">THE PILGRIMS OF THE MIDDLE AGES II.</p>

<p class="drop-cap04">THE war of retaliation, which the Sultan waged against
the king of Cyprus, interrupted the flow of pilgrims to
the East in the first half of the fifteenth century. Moreover,
the sultans, more especially Bursbai (1423-38), began to
squeeze the Christian merchants. Their grievances raised the
ire of Emmanuel Piloti, a native of Crete, who spent twenty-five
years in Egypt and Syria, and acquired considerable
insight into affairs generally. He was moved to compose
a missive which he addressed to Pope Eugenius IV (1431-47).
In this he spoke of the achievements of the Crusaders, insisting
that Mohammad had called for toleration of the
Christians, a call that was disregarded by Sultan Bursbai,
who oppressed them grievously. The resources of the
Sultan were enormous. He ruled from Mecca to India, and
had full control of the spicery that was unshipped at “Torre,
as the port of St. Katherine is now called.” He levied 10 per
cent. on the value of these goods, not once, but several times
over, as they passed through his dominions. Why, asked
Piloti, did not the head of all Christendom arise in defence of
the Christians, sally forth like the Crusaders, conquer Cairo,
and supplant the Sultanate? In doing so, he would have
the support of the Arabs of the desert.</p>

<p>The Church of Rome, however, was bent on propaganda
along more peaceful lines. After the Crusades the Franciscans,
starting from Jerusalem, penetrated into Tartary and China.
The plan was now formed of securing a foothold in Sinai as
a stepping-stone on the way to India. With this end in view<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
Pope Calixtus III (1455-58) addressed a letter to the Franciscans
urging that they should secure further sites, including
one on Mount Sinai (“concedimus ut nova loca etiam in
Monte Sina capere possitis”).<a name="FNanchor_273_273" id="FNanchor_273_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a> The direct steps that were
taken are not known, but in the course of the fifteenth
century we hear of Franciscans, popularly known as Cassis,
moving to and fro between Gaza where they had a house,
and the convent, where at first a room and later a chapel was
reserved for the celebration of a Roman Catholic service.</p>

<p>The desire to penetrate to India and beyond was very
general. Thus, Pero Tafur, a Castilian nobleman, arrived at the
convent in the year 1435 on his way to Tur, where he hoped
to embark for India. But at Tur he met Niccolo da Conti,
for many years a resident in India, who was on his way to
Cairo, where he intended to lodge a complaint with the Sultan
(Bursbai), because of the indignities to which he was exposed.
His account made Pero Tafur give up the thought of his
journey.</p>

<p>Tafur found only about fifty to sixty monks at the convent,
which had fallen on evil days. The Turk was advancing.
In the year 1453 he took possession of Constantinople. As
he advanced on Sinai, he laid a heavy hand on the convent,
from which he claimed an annual tribute of three hundred
ducats. Jacob, the patriarch of Jerusalem († 1482), hereupon
despatched a monk of Sinai to the princes of Europe, with a
letter asking for help. This monk, besides the letter, carried
with him some valuable relics, including a tooth of
St. Katherine.<a name="FNanchor_274_274" id="FNanchor_274_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a> His appeal met with a ready response.
King Louis XI of France (1463-83) made an annual grant
to the convent of two thousand ducats,<a name="FNanchor_275_275" id="FNanchor_275_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a> which was still paid
by King Charles VIII in 1497 (Harff, p. 122). Queen Isabella
of Spain (1481-1504) gave five hundred ducats a year, a sum
which was still paid by King Phillip in 1558.<a name="FNanchor_276_276" id="FNanchor_276_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a> The emperor
Maximilian I (1493-1517) and the king of Hungary gave
money (Fabri, ii. 623).</p>

<p>Unrest, however, now spread to the Bedawyn. A German<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
pilgrim named Leman in the year 1472 sailed from Beirut to
Alexandria in the largest galley of the time, which carried
two hundred and sixty Christians and nine hundred Moslim.
He was bent on going to the convent, but was prevented from
entering Sinai owing to the hostile attitude of the Bedawyn.<a name="FNanchor_277_277" id="FNanchor_277_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a>
However, matters again improved, and the pilgrims and the
accounts of voyages multiplied. The most notable accounts
which describe a visit to the convent are enumerated below.<a name="FNanchor_278_278" id="FNanchor_278_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a></p>

<p>Among these pilgrims the Flemish knight Anselm Adornes
and his party were advised by the monk of Sinai who acted
as their guide from Egypt, to adopt the appearance of monks
in order to travel with safety. They reached the convent
where there were about forty monks in residence, who told
them that the Arabs frequently invaded the convent (p. 162).
On one of their raids they entered the sanctuary and broke
open the marble chest which contained the relics of St. Katherine
but, instead of the expected treasures, they found a few
bones (Gregor, p. 504).</p>

<p>Towards the close of the century the accounts of pilgrims
show that these now came in large parties. In 1479 the
Nürnberg patricians Hans Tucher and Sebald Rieter, went to
Gaza where they entered into an agreement with a dragoman
that was set down in writing to convey them to the convent
or Cairo. This agreement is worded exactly in the same
way as these agreements are worded at the present day.
They travelled with seven Franciscan friars, and on their
arrival at the convent Latin mass was celebrated (Tucher,
p. 365). Again, in 1483 two parties of Germans, numbering
twenty persons in all, visited Palestine and Syria. They
included Bernhard von Breydenbach († 1493), of the Chapter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
of Mayence, who came east with the artist Rewich of Utrecht,
whose drawings served to illustrate his patron’s account of his
journey. The other party included Felix Fabri, who acted
as chaplain to the young Count Solms. Fabri became a friar
in 1452 “out of love of St. Katherine, his spouse.” On the
arrival at the convent of their party mass was also celebrated
in the chapel set apart for Latin use (Fabri, ii. 547).</p>

<p>Another pilgrim was Jan van Aerts of Malines, who sailed
from Venice for the East in 1484, with a party of twenty
Franciscan friars travelling with a Portuguese whom Jan
referred to as the <i>grand facteur</i>. It was customary at the time
for each visitor to deposit two ducats in the chest of St.
Katherine. In addition to this, the grand facteur gave a
thousand ducats to the monks. From the convent he and
his party proceeded to Tur, where they took boat for India.
But at the port of Medina they were forced to turn back
owing to the enmity of the Arabs. The desire to penetrate
to the far East was increasing. Mynher Joos van Ghistelles
visited the convent in 1485, and went on to Tur, where
he met the Venetian Bonajuto del Pan (Albani) and the
Milanese Benedetto da Navara, who were on their way to
Ormuz on the Persian Gulf, in order to visit the coral and
pearl fisheries (Joos, p. 227). In 1487 the two Portuguese,
Pedro da Cavillan and Alfonso da Paiva, came from Cairo to
Tur, from where they sailed for Aden, Alfonso on his way to
Ethiopia, the lesser India, in search of Prester John; Pedro
on his way to the coast of Malabar, in order to see the spice-growing
districts and to collect information on Madagascar
and Calicut, which he laid before his king.<a name="FNanchor_279_279" id="FNanchor_279_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a> In 1489 Joannes
de Hese passed through the convent and Tur on his way to
India. The Ritter von Harff went from the convent with
a letter of introduction to the monks at the convent of St.
John in Tur, where he left for Mecca and Madagascar, returning
to Egypt by way of the Mountains of the Moon and the
course of the Nile. Von Harff illustrated the account of his
journeys with many cuts, of which the one here reproduced
shows the knight before St. Katherine (<a href="#i169">Fig. 21</a>). These various
writings supply information on the cost and routes of travel
at the time. According to the English <i>Information for Pilgrims</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
of about 1450, the cost of going from Venice to the Holy Land
and back was 50 ducats.<a name="FNanchor_280_280" id="FNanchor_280_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_280_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a> One party of pilgrims of 1483 paid
42 ducats each on the understanding that they were allowed
full time to see the Holy Places, and received two meals a day;
the other party paid 45 ducats each, their meals including
wine. The party of twenty persons in 1484 paid a thousand
ducats, <i>i.e.</i> 50 ducats for each person. Half the money
was paid at Venice before starting, the other half on arrival at
Jaffa. A certain Zülnhart fell ill at Venice after paying his 25
ducats, and as he was unable to sail, his money was forfeited.<a name="FNanchor_281_281" id="FNanchor_281_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a></p>

<p>From Jaffa the pilgrims visited Jerusalem, where he had
the option of returning home <i>via</i> Jaffa or going on to Sinai
and Cairo. If he decided on this course he was allowed ten
ducats on his return fare, and was provided by the Franciscans
with an escort to Gaza. The charge for the round was
twenty-three ducats, half of which was paid at Jerusalem,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
the other at Gaza. An agreement was drawn up in writing
by the dragoman, the wording of which is much the same as
the one that is drawn up at the present day. In the course
of the fifteenth century Noe Bianchi, a Franciscan, wrote a
guide book called <i>The Way from Venice to the Holy Sepulchre
and Mount Sinai</i>, which contained practical advice for
pilgrims. It estimated the cost of going the round from Venice
to Jerusalem, Gaza, the convent, Cairo and back to Venice
at two hundred ducats, <i>i.e.</i> one hundred for general expenses,
fifty to serve in case of sickness, fifty for the sea-voyage.
The pilgrim was advised to carry a mattress (<i>strapontino</i>), a
barrel for water, a barrel for wine, and he was warned against
discussing matters of faith with infidels.</p>

<p>The chief danger which threatened the pilgrims was sickness.
Many died on the way. The Italians in 1384, between
Cairo and the convent, met nine Frenchmen; eleven out of
their party of twenty had died on the way. In 1483 there was
so much sickness in Gaza that many pilgrims gave up the
thought of going to the convent; and the young Count
Solms died on the way back (Fabri, ii. 446). There were
other dangers. Arnold von Harff in 1497 saw the effect of
a sandstorm which had cut off a caravan; the corpses of six
hundred camels and of fifty men, mauled and rotting, strewed
the roadside (p. 120). The pilgrims were often in dread of
the Bedawyn, who swooped down on them clamouring for food,
and calling for the payment of dues for crossing their territory.
The shortage of food at the time was aggravated, no doubt, by
the curtailed largess at the convent. The pilgrims of 1483
carried three times as much bread as they needed for themselves
in order to meet all possible demands.</p>

<p>The routes followed by the pilgrims were the ordinary
caravan routes, subject to some variation. Thus the pilgrims
of 1479, mindful of the raiding of a caravan by some Catalans
between Gaza and Tur, left Gaza by “a route that had not been
followed for twenty years;” they went by “Rappa” (Rafa),
“Makati Nockra” (low-lying ground), where there were many
gazelles and entered the “Wadi el Arish” (Rieter, p. 91). The
pilgrims of 1483, after leaving “Gaza,” stopped at “Lebhem,”
where there was a mosque, crossed a sandy plain to “Chawatha,”
“called Cades by the Latins,” where it rained, and where
there were large cisterns in ruins (Fabri, ii. 494), Ain Kadeis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
of the present day. Here they entered the “Wadi Gayan”
(“Gyon” of Joos, p. 147), the present Wadi el Jain, and stopped
in the “Wadi Wadalar,” the scene of the Catalan outrage (Fabri,
ii. 502; Breydenbach, p. 187), with the “Wadi Magdabee” or
“Mahgaby” and the “Gebel Hallel,” the present Gebel Hellal.
They then camped near “Magara,” a name signifying holes,
where Fabri, setting out from the camp, ascended a hill on
which he found piles of stones and fluttering rags which he
thought were intended to work magic, so he tore them down
and set up a cross, but he well-nigh missed his way going
back to the tents. The next stopping place was “Hachsene,”
an important watering station, where the party of the year
met many Arabs, and where the pilgrims stored water for three
days. This was doubtless the present Bir Hassana, for they
were moving over white ground (noted as white chalk mounds
on the modern map) to “Minshene” (Fabri, ii. 515), modern
Minshera, where they entered the “Wadi el Arish,” camping at
“El Harock” or “Barak” (Fabri, ii. 510), the “Wadi Torcko”
or “Borricko” of the travellers of 1479 (p. 697). Here they must
have been near Nakhl. After passing the white mountain
“Chalep” or “Calpio” (perhaps the Colebmaleo of Jacopo), they
reached the white “Wadi Meshmar” (Mesmar of Joos), where
silver and gold had been worked in the mines as was shown by
the smelting. The name corresponds to modern Gebel Megmar.
Following the “Hallicub,” where the water was bad, they
crossed the wilderness “Elphogaya,” and then entered the red
sandstone district of “Rackani” (or “Rochi” or “Roachyne”),
where they encamped in an exposed situation. On the following
day they descended along the steepest gorge Fabri had ever seen,
the modern Naghb el Racki. At its foot they camped in <i>Ramathaym</i>,
<i>i.e.</i> bushes, and saw a star at night which, they were
told, stood above the convent of St. Katherine. Later stopping
places were “Scholie” or “Schoyle,” “Abelharock,” and
“Magara” (or “Mackera” or “Mackasea”), where the road
branched off to Tur.</p>

<p>The pilgrims of 1479 and 1483 noted the place where Moses
pastured his flocks near “Wackya,” probably the present El
Watiyeh, which is still associated both with Nebi Saleh and
with Moses.<a name="FNanchor_282_282" id="FNanchor_282_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a> On the twelfth day after leaving Gaza, the
pilgrims arrived at the convent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>Here they were taken the usual round of the churches and
chapels, and ascended the Mountain of the Law, access to
which was now forbidden to the Jews. They repaired to the
convent of the Arbaïn from which they made the ascent of
Gebel Katrîn. They saw the stone in the shape of a Golden
Calf, about which Fabri had his doubts (ii. 594); the stone
on which the Tables were broken; the convent of St. John
Climacus; the convent of SS. Cosmas and Damianus, with its
well-kept garden; the spot where Dathan and Abiram disappeared
(ii. 590); the boulder with twelve channels of
water, one for each of the twelve tribes. Finally, they were
shown the relics of St. Katherine, lying in their chest, into
which they dropped two ducats each, and were allowed to
touch the relics with trinkets they had brought for this
purpose (ii. 600). The flow of sacred oil had ceased. There
was none available in 1483; in 1489 it was collected at the
rate of three drops a week (Joannes de Hese, p. 181). This
is the last we hear of it. Pilgrims received, instead, a piece of
cotton wool or of silk which was taken out of the chest of St.
Katherine, and steeped in the oil of the lamps. The cessation
of oil was attributed to the desecration of the shrine by the
Arabs.</p>

<p>From the convent some of the pilgrims went on to Cairo
by way of “El Phat,” and the white hills of “Lacrara,”
where they joined the caravan road coming from Tur. Further
stations along the road were “Enaspo” (Wadi Nasb), “Horenden”
or “Dorenden” (Wadi Gharandel), “Werdachii”
(Werdan), and “Marath” or “Merach,” perhaps the old
Mara, and the present Ayun Musa. These stopping-places
are the same as those chosen by pilgrims and travellers at
the present day.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XVII</h2>

<p class="pch">THE LATER HISTORY OF THE CONVENT</p>

<p class="drop-cap04">THE size of the caravans that plied between Sinai and
Egypt were a source of wonder to the mediæval
pilgrim. This development of trade received a check in the
sixteenth century, through the discovery of the sea-route
to India by the Portuguese. Prince Henry of Portugal († 1460)
brought the west coast of Africa within reach of his country.
In the year 1487 Bartholomew Diaz sailed from Portugal to
the Cape of Good Hope, which Vasco da Gama doubled ten
years later, sailing on to Calicut. Every year a fleet now
left Lisbon for India, where spicery was shipped direct for
Portugal.</p>

<p>This trade detracted from the resources of the Sultan, and
spelt ruin to the seaports of Italy. In 1503 the Sultan
addressed a letter to the Pope in which he threatened destruction
to the Holy Places, including the Holy Sepulchre and the
convent of Sinai, if the Portuguese were not interfered with.
But King Manuel of Portugal induced the Pope to ignore the
letter, and, on his side, offered spicery free of duty to the
Venetians, if they fetched it at Lisbon, instead of Alexandria.
But the Venetians, averse to the change, persuaded the Sultan
to set up a direct communication by boat between Suez and
India, and a tower was accordingly built to fortify Suez.
Tur was passed over; its days as a port on the way to India
were drawing to a close, for the Portuguese were determined
to monopolise the trade with India. They seized a boat
coming from Egypt with the 24,000 ducats it contained.
They fitted out a war fleet (1504) which enforced their superior
claims in India, and attacked all other shipping. In 1509
they entered the Red Sea with their war fleet, and interfered
with the pilgrims to Mecca. It was in vain that the Venetians,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
whose annual turn-over at Alexandria fell from 600,000 to
100,000 ducats in 1511, pleaded with the Sultan to diminish
the tax on Eastern goods, so as to enable them to compete with
the Portuguese. The Sultanate was at the mercy of short-sighted
and intriguing emirs, and was weakening. The
conquering Ottoman Turk was steadily gaining ground.
There had been rejoicing at Cairo when Constantinople, in
1453, fell to the power of Islam, but the struggle for supremacy
soon afterwards began between the Egyptian and the Ottoman
Sultanate. In 1516 the Ottoman Sultan Selim († 1520)
occupied Damascus, and in the following year he advanced
along the road of El Arish with wheeled transport. After
defeating the Mameluks at Radunieh in 1517, he led his
disciplined janissaries into Cairo, where he appropriated the
sacred banner of Islam and the relics, which he removed to
Constantinople.</p>

<p>In the meantime the shipping languished even at Suez.
Odoardo Barbosa, who was sent to Egypt to report on matters
of navigation to the merchants of Italy in 1516, mentioned
Suez as the station for spicery, but added that the traffic had
almost ceased.<a name="FNanchor_283_283" id="FNanchor_283_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a> Certainly the Ottoman Sultan, roused to
the needs of the hour, made the attempt to facilitate the transit
of Eastern goods by cutting through the isthmus of Suez.
He also built a castle at Suez in order to defend himself against
the Portuguese. But the centre of the Ottoman rule was no
longer Cairo, but Constantinople, to which the wealthy more
and more migrated. Egypt was placed under a pasha, who was
appointed at Constantinople, and who was frequently changed
so as to anticipate any scheme on his part of making himself
into an independent ruler. Cairo retained its university and
remained a centre of learning; its halcyon days as a centre
of art and luxury were at an end.</p>

<p>The Suez canal was still in course of construction in 1529,
but was never finished,<a name="FNanchor_284_284" id="FNanchor_284_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a> and no term was set on the advance of
the Portuguese. In 1541 Dom John (João) de Castro, who bore
the proud title of viceroy of India, sailed up the Red Sea with
a fleet, intending to attack Suez, but when he espied the
fort and the ships at anchor there, he turned back. In
sailing up the Gulf of Suez, and again in sailing down, Dom John<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
stopped at Tur, where he communed with a monk of Sinai,
who told him that the convent was occupied by monks of the
order of Montserrat (<i>sic</i>), and that the body of St. Katherine
had been removed to Cairo. Another informant denied all
knowledge of this fact. Dom John was a man of some pretensions,
who identified Suez as Heroöpolis, and Tur as Aelana of
classic times. His observations were laid down in a <i>Description
of the Lands bordering on the Red Sea</i>, which Sir Walter
Raleigh considered of such importance, that he had it translated
into English.<a name="FNanchor_285_285" id="FNanchor_285_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a></p>

<p>Throughout this period we hear little of pilgrims and of
the convent. The spirit of the Reformation was abroad, and
the thought of St. Katherine was losing its hold on the
imagination of Europe. Gregor, prior of the Carthusian house
at Gaming, who came to the convent in 1507 together with
Martin Baumgarten, stated that the monks were miserable
owing to the clamorous Arabs, who occupied the mosque
and kept their festival on the Mount of the Law as already
related. In the estimation of Gregor, the monks of Sinai
professed the order of St. Basil, but, he declared, they would
be glad to be taken under the protection of Rome (p. 498).
About the year 1546 the learned Belon of Mans, who travelled
in the interest of science and archæology, visited Sinai, which
he mentioned in his <i>Observations de certaines singularités</i>,
etc., a work that reflects the spirit of the new age. Belon
remarked on the Franciscan settlement at Gaza, the arsenal
at Suez, and the canal of thirty miles’ length. In the convent
he found about sixty monks.<a name="FNanchor_286_286" id="FNanchor_286_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a></p>

<p>Of the bishops at this period we know very little. There
was an interregnum of about thirty years before 1540, which
may be connected with the rule of Sultan Selim. According
to information preserved at the convent, he abstracted the
original <i>firmân</i> which was supposed to have been given to the
convent by Mohammad. Sultan Selim was responsible
for the fortified stations along the route for pilgrims from
Egypt to Mecca, of which one was built at Ajrud near Suez,
the second at Nakhl, on the high desert, and the third at
Akaba, which was situated east of the ancient Aila. These
stations were reckoned about three days’ journey from one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
another, and the road continued in use till recent times.
But whatever the reason, the bishop of Sinai at this time
incurred the displeasure of the surrounding prelates. Marcus,
the Cyprian, who was appointed in 1540, perhaps owing to
some fault of his own (Nectarius called him κάκος),<a name="FNanchor_287_287" id="FNanchor_287_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a> was
deposed by a synod held in Egypt under the auspices of the
patriarchs of Alexandria, of Cairo, and of Jerusalem, and the
bishopric of Sinai was declared abrogated.<a name="FNanchor_288_288" id="FNanchor_288_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a></p>

<p>But a new protector to the monks now arose in the Tsar
of Muscovy, who, when Constantinople fell to the Turks,
took it upon himself to protect the orthodox. In the year
1547 Gregorius, a monk of Sinai, visited Moscow, where he
complained of the tax which the Turk levied on the convent.
The Tsar at the time was Ivan the Terrible (1533-84), who
forthwith arranged that Gennadius, archdeacon of St. Sophia,
at Novgorod, together with the merchant Posniakow and
another should visit the patriarch of Alexandria and the
archbishop (<i>sic</i>) of Sinai, and present them with 1000 ducats
each. At the convent, after praying at the shrine of St.
Katherine, they spread over it a covering of gold brocade,
a gift of the Tsar. Posniakow, to whom we owe an account
of the embassy, looked upon the monks as connected with
St. Basil, and described the mosque inside the convent as
originally a church of St. Basil.<a name="FNanchor_289_289" id="FNanchor_289_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a></p>

<p>The Muscovite further arranged that a caravan bearing
food should be annually despatched from Cairo to the convent,
at his expense, as we learn from the account of the German
pilgrim Wormbser, who went from Egypt to the convent in
the year 1561 (<i>Reissbuch</i>, 1609, p. 396 ff.). His companion, Count
Loewenstein, on his return to Alexandria, there asked for an
official attestation of having been the Long Pilgrimage, which
he included in the account of his journey (<i>Ibid.</i>, p. 393). These
travellers in 1561 found between thirty and forty monks at
the convent, but were told that these sometimes left the place
altogether because of the clamorous Arabs (Loewenstein, p. 369).
It had recently stood empty four or five years (<i>Ibid.</i>, p. 369).
Another party of Germans, who reached the convent in 1565,
actually found it empty and its gates walled up. They were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
met outside by a monk who, apprized of their coming, hurried
over from Tur to act as their guide. From the height of the
Mount of the Law they looked down on the empty convent
with its deserted garden (<i>Ibid.</i>, Helfferich, p. 726).</p>

<p>Owing to Muscovite influence a change was effected.
A letter is extant drafted by Jeremiah II, patriarch of Constantinople
(1572-78), which bears the signature of the patriarch
of Antioch, the patriarch of Jerusalem, and others by
which the bishopric of Sinai was restored.<a name="FNanchor_290_290" id="FNanchor_290_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a> The decision was
based on the decree of Justinian which is dated to the year
551 and is preserved at the convent, but which is looked upon
as a forgery. Anyhow, a prelate was reinstated in the person
of Eugenius (1565-83), who, in the capacity of “bishop of
Sinai and Raithou,” wrote to Emperor Maximilian II (1564-76),
declaring that the monks were called upon to pay 5000 ducats
to the Turkish Sultan, which were they unable to raise.
The outcome of the appeal is not recorded. They probably
made an appeal also to King Henri III of France (1574-89).<a name="FNanchor_291_291" id="FNanchor_291_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_291_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a>
In the year 1579 Eugenius of Sinai was in Jerusalem,
where the patriarch Germanus abdicated because of old
age.<a name="FNanchor_292_292" id="FNanchor_292_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_292_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a></p>

<p>Direct intercourse with Russia continued. We hear of
one Korobeïnikoff who was in Sinai in 1583, and again in
1593. It was, perhaps, with the help of the Muscovite that
Bishop Anastasius I (1583-92) laid down the mosaic pavement
in the convent church, which had been destroyed by Arab
treasure-seekers. Anastasius was succeeded by Laurentius
(1592-1617), but Melitos, patriarch of Alexandria, objected
to his appointment, whereupon he appealed to Sophronios VI,
patriarch of Jerusalem (1579-1606), who ratified his appointment.<a name="FNanchor_293_293" id="FNanchor_293_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_293_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a>
Perhaps the gates of the convent were walled up in
connection with these difficulties, and anyone wishing to enter
was now hauled up by means of a rope and a pulley. Henri
Castale who visited Sinai in 1600, was the first to describe the
arrangement, which continued till the British occupation of
Egypt. Castale, in the account of his journey, enlarged on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
the starving men and women in the desert. He found one
starving monk in the convent.<a name="FNanchor_294_294" id="FNanchor_294_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a></p>

<p>But things now improved under Bishop Joasaph, who
ruled from 1617 to 1658, and travellers gave a better
account of the convent.</p>

<p>The thought of the “inscriptions of the children of Israel”
brought Neitzschitz into the desert about the year 1639. He
was a Lutheran to whom “many of the stories were fables.”
He was received by the “archbishop Joasaph” and found
twenty-three monks at the convent, who distributed food
daily to between fifty and a hundred Arabs.<a name="FNanchor_295_295" id="FNanchor_295_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_295_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a> The thought
of the inscription was prominent also in the mind of Balthazar
de Monconys, who, in 1647, visited the convent. Here he
remarked on the tunic of gold brocade embroidered with
pearls and on the splendid tiaras, presents of the Muscovite,
that were worn by Joasaph.<a name="FNanchor_296_296" id="FNanchor_296_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_296_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a> Again, Thévenot came to the
convent in 1658, and saw a silver chest, a gift from the empress
Anna of Russia, in which the relics of St. Katherine were now
enshrined. Thévenot related that on some days as many as
150 Arabs, on others as many as 400, clamouring for food,
assembled outside the convent. He also related that the
Turks had destroyed the church which the monks owned at
Tur (perhaps that of St. John the Baptist), in order to make
room for a fort where an <i>aga</i> was stationed, who had the
command of cannon.<a name="FNanchor_297_297" id="FNanchor_297_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_297_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a></p>

<p>A papal bull, apparently the last, was granted to the
convent by Pope Urban VIII (1623-37). It confirmed the
monks in their various possessions, and has the additional
interest that it enumerated the popes who previously granted
bulls to the monks. They were Honorius III (1216-27),
Gregory IX (1227-41), Paul II (1458-64), Innocent VIII
(1484-92), Julius II (1503-13), Leo IX (1513-19), and Paul III
(1534-50).</p>

<p>During the rule of Joasaph, Nectarius, a Cretan by birth and
a man of considerable ability, came to the convent, the interests
of which he furthered in various ways. The Vaivode Basil
(1634-61), of Moldavia, was encouraging the establishment of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
Greek schools in his dominion. Nectarius visited Athens,
Bukarest, and Jassy, where the monks of Sinai now built
priories and secured a lasting foothold. It was probably
Nectarius who definitely secured the title and standing of an
archbishop to the ruler of Sinai. The title had been applied
to Simeon as early as 1211 by the doge of Venice in connection
with the property which the convent held in Crete, but the
rulers continued to style themselves bishop. However, the
title once claimed was retrospectively applied. Nectarius,
after his return to the convent, compiled an <i>Epitome of history
from the earliest times</i>, with special chapters on the convent
and a list of its rulers. They are all designated as archbishops.
It was probably due to Nectarius, also, that many MSS. were
brought from Crete and elsewhere and added to the convent
library. At the convent itself literary activity was resumed,
and we hear of a gift of paper to the monks that was conveyed
there on camel-back.<a name="FNanchor_298_298" id="FNanchor_298_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_298_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a></p>

<p>At the death of Joasaph, Nectarius was chosen as his
successor. He was in Gaza on his way to Jerusalem to seek
confirmation of his appointment at the hands of the patriarch
Païsios, when he was met by delegates from Jerusalem, bearing
the news that Païsios was dead, and that Nectarius was chosen
patriarch. As Joasaph died in 1658, and the meeting happened
in April 1660, the intercourse between the sees seems to
have been attended with difficulty. The rule at the convent
therefore devolved on Ananias (1658-68), who was followed by
Joannicus (1668-1703).</p>

<p>According to Lacroix, the Muscovite fell out with the
patriarch of Constantinople in 1671, and summoned to Moscow
several prelates, among them “Antoninus, bishop of Sinai.”
He dared not refuse, and was kept in Moscow for over a year.<a name="FNanchor_299_299" id="FNanchor_299_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_299_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a>
But no prelate of this name appears in the list of the bishops.</p>

<p>About this time the Papacy made renewed efforts at
propaganda, with the help of the Franciscans. Pope Innocent
XI (1675-89) entered into correspondence with the
patriarch of Cairo with a view to winning over the Copts of
Egypt to the Roman Catholic faith, and Francesco Maria of
Salerno spent several years in Cairo where he established a
school. He also visited Sinai, but the Copts found it impossible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
to accept the declaration of faith that was submitted to them,
and nothing came of it.<a name="FNanchor_300_300" id="FNanchor_300_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_300_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a></p>

<p>Joannicus, in 1672, was in Bethlehem where he subscribed
to a declaration against Calvin, in which the Maronites, the
Copts and the Armenian Christians joined. In 1675 he went
on an embassy to Turkey. He also engaged in correspondence
with Ignatius, archbishop of Ochrida in Serbia, on the <i>firmân</i>
which had been granted to the monks of Sinai by the emperor
Justinian. A visit to Moldavia resulted in the gift of the
property called Rimineke to the monks of Sinai by Vaivode
Brancovan († 1719). The traveller Poncet, who visited the
convent about the year 1699, coming from Sherm, was received
by Joannicus, who was in his ninety-third year and paralytic.
Like other travellers Poncet was hauled into the convent by
means of the seat attached to a rope. He was treated to some
of the liqueur called <i>arac</i>, which was made by the monks out
of the fermented juice of the date.<a name="FNanchor_301_301" id="FNanchor_301_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_301_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a></p>

<p>The prelate in succession to Joannicus was Cosmas I of
Chalcedon, who became patriarch of Constantinople within
a year of his election, but he soon abdicated and returned
to the convent where he spent the rest of his days under
Athanasius II of Bari (1706-18). The next prelate was
Joannicus II of Mytilene (1718-22), during the term of whose
rule Jeremiah, patriarch of Constantinople, was deposed by
the vizier and exiled to Sinai. He was staying there at the
time of Bishop Pococke’s visit (i. 150).</p>

<p>It was probably Athanasius of Bari who received the
Franciscan prefect Claude Sicard of the mission <i>De Propaganda
Fide</i>, wearing an exquisite crown. The Franciscan
prefect wrote a short account of his visit which attracted the
attention of Bishop Pococke and was translated into English
by Bishop Clayton in 1753. This translation was addressed
to the Society of Antiquaries in London, and Bishop Clayton
offered the sum of £500, spread over five years, to assist in
an exploration of Mount Sinai. But no definite step was
taken in the matter, its chief result being to add to the Biblical
explorers of the peninsula.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>

<p>Chief among these was Bishop Pococke, whose <i>Description
of the East</i>, first published in 1743, attained considerable
celebrity. Several chapters were devoted to an account of
Sinai and the progress of the Israelites. It contains a careful
description of the monastic buildings with several plans.
Bishop Pococke, like other travellers before and since, accepted
the sites pointed out by the monks as the actual spots mentioned
in the Biblical narrative, regardless of the impossibilities
implied. He only questioned the spot where Dathan and
Abiram were swallowed, remarking that when this happened
they had left the desert of Sinai (i. 145).</p>

<p>Owing to the difficulties of dealing with the claims of the
Bedawyn, the prelates of Sinai now found it preferable to take
up their residence in one of the dependencies of the convent.</p>

<p>Nicephorus Mortales, surnamed Glaukos (1729-49), was
from Crete, to which he returned and where he died. His body
was conveyed to the convent for interment. The next prelate
was Constantius (1749-59), who resided for the most part in
Moldavia under Vaivode Michael, paying an occasional visit
to Sinai. On one occasion he was accompanied by Khalil
Sabag, who wrote an account of his visit. The next prelate
Cyrillus II (1759-90) dwelt in Smyrna, Jerusalem and Moldavia.
He was in contact with Carsten Niebuhr, who visited
Sinai in 1762, where he was the first European to visit and
describe the great ravines at Serabit. Cyrillus was in relation
also with the traveller Volney, who visited the convent in
1783, where he found fifty monks.</p>

<p>It was owing to the efforts of Cyrillus II that the standing
of the convent of Sinai as an independent centre was definitely
established. A synod met in Constantinople in 1782, which
declared in favour of its autonomy. The archbishop is elected
by a council of the monks, who manage the affairs of the
convent in Sinai and its branch establishment in Cairo. The
archbishop is always selected from the priests of the monastery.
He is consecrated as bishop by the patriarch of Jerusalem in
consequence of the ancient connection, and he becomes one
of the four independent archbishops of the Greek Church,
the others being at Cyprus, Moscow and Ochrida.<a name="FNanchor_302_302" id="FNanchor_302_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_302_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a></p>

<p>Cyrillus II was the last prelate who paid a visit to the
convent for over a hundred years. The reason was that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
large sums and gifts had to be presented to the Arabs by the
new prelate on his installation. These were so considerable
that the monks, in their impoverished state, were unable to
raise them. Perhaps owing to this difficulty, there was an
interregnum of four years, between the death of Cyrillus in
1790 and the establishment as prelate of Dorotheus of Byzantium
(1794-96), after whose death there was again an interregnum
of eight years.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XVIII</h2>

<p class="pch">SINAI IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY</p>

<p class="drop-cap04">THE close of the eighteenth century witnessed events in
Egypt which directly affected the conditions of life in
Sinai; they further reduced the man of the desert in his
resources.</p>

<p>Since the conquest of Egypt by the Turks in 1517 the
country was administered by a pasha who was appointed by
the Sultan at Constantinople. But the order of the Sultan
to Ali Bey to join in a war against Russia in 1769 met with a
direct refusal; the Egyptian saw his chance of proclaiming
his independence. The revolt of the pasha of Egypt gave
Bonaparte an ostensible reason for occupying Alexandria in
1796. Bonaparte’s imagination was fired by the thought of
incorporating Egypt, the land of antiquity, in his world
dominion. As part of this wider scheme he addressed a letter
as <i>général en chef</i> to the monks of Sinai in 1798, in which
he took them under his protection, “to the end,” as he said,
“that they should hand on to future races the tradition of
his conquest, as he was filled with respect for Moses and the
Jews, and because the monks were learned men living in the
barbarity of the desert.” He further decreed that henceforth
the Arab Bedawyn had no claim whatever on the monks, that
they should be left to devote themselves unmolested to the
claims of their religion, that they should be exempt from
paying tribute or tax on imports or exports on the produce of
their property in Schio (<i>i.e.</i> Chios) and Cyprus, that they should
freely enjoy their rights in Syria and in Cairo, and that their
ruler should be independent of the patriarch.<a name="FNanchor_303_303" id="FNanchor_303_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_303_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a></p>

<p>At the order of Bonaparte the gentlemen Coutelle and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
Rosières were sent on a tour of inspection to collect material
for the work which he planned. On this tour they came
to the convent of Sinai in 1800, where they found six monks
and twenty-two lay brothers in residence. The east wall of
the convent, built by Justinian, had collapsed. By order of
General Kléber at Cairo, the monk Hallil, with forty-two
masons and a hundred and fifty camels, were dispatched from
Cairo to do the necessary repair. The camels were furnished
by the Towarah.<a name="FNanchor_304_304" id="FNanchor_304_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_304_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a></p>

<p>In the meantime Nelson, scouring the seas in search of
the French fleet, came upon it near the coast of Egypt, and
attacked and scattered it at the Battle of the Nile (Oct., 1798).
The Turks, aware that Bonaparte’s descent on Egypt was
prompted by his desire for self-aggrandisement, felt called
upon to declare war on the French in Egypt (1799). Hereupon
Bonaparte, with nearly the whole of his army, marched
along the desert road to Gaza and took Jaffa by assault, but
a few months later he was in full retreat. A Turkish army soon
afterwards reached Aboukir and joined forces with the
British fleet, but Bonaparte inflicted a crushing defeat on
them. He then left Egypt leaving his army in charge of
General Kléber. But a further expedition was launched by
the Turk, one detachment of troops was landed at Damietta,
another under Yussuf Pasha approached by the El Arish road.
They were defeated by the French, but General Kléber soon
afterwards was assassinated (June, 1808). The English now
effected a landing at Aboukir (March, 1801), and the French,
after some struggles, evacuated the country.</p>

<p>In Egypt itself confusion reigned. The Mameluks were
regaining their influence, when Mehemed Ali († 1849), the leader
of an Albanian corps, secured the adherence of the sheykhs
and claimed the Pashalik with the support of the French. An
expedition made by the British to oppose him in 1807 miscarried.
In 1811 he caused a massacre of the Mameluks and
extended his influence by carrying war into Arabia and invading
Syria. The interference of the English reduced, but
did not break, his power. In 1841 he secured the hereditary
sovereignty of Egypt.</p>

<p>The period of upheaval naturally reacted on the desert
and rendered travelling unsafe. Seetzen visited the convent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
under Russian orders and found the road dangerous. There
were twenty-five monks in the convent, who longed for the end
of the Turkish government and the establishment of European
influence in Cairo.<a name="FNanchor_305_305" id="FNanchor_305_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_305_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a> Seetzen was murdered in Syria on a later
journey. Again the traveller Boutin was in Serabit in 1811,
where he scrawled his name on a stone in the temple where
Rüppell found it. Boutin also was murdered in Syria. Burckhardt
travelled in the disguise of a Bedawyn and repeatedly
visited Sinai, and the convent (1816, 1822). Both Rüppell
and Burckhardt travelled in the interest of geography.</p>

<p>With the return of more settled conditions travellers
became more numerous. Lord Prudhoe and Major Felix
(1827) were among those who visited the ruins of Serabit.
The account of their journey was lost, but Lord Prudhoe,
after inspecting the temple ruins, was the first and, as far as
I am aware, the only traveller to whom it occurred that this
might be the sanctuary that was visited by the Israelites.
The fact was recorded by Edward Robinson who came into
Sinai in the interest of Biblical research in 1838 and 1852 (i. 79)
and who was himself immensely impressed by the ruins at
Serabit. Other travellers who made a prolonged stay were
Laborde and Linant (1828), to whom we owe the first detailed
and illustrated account of the convent church, its architecture,
its great mosaics and its numerous side chapels; Tischendorf,
who secured the famous MS. for Petrograd, as mentioned
above; Bartlett, whose rapid visit in 1839 established
interesting geological facts, more especially with regard to
the lie of the land between Sinai and Syria; and Lepsius,
who came into Sinai in 1845 for the express purpose of copying
the hieroglyph inscriptions at Maghara and Serabit, which
he incorporated in his <i>Denkmäler</i> (1860).</p>

<p>Under the rule of Mehemed Ali safety was restored to the
<i>hadj</i> route across Sinai by the rebuilding of the forts at Adjrud
(near Suez), Nakhl and Akaba. The settlement of a garrison
brought regularity of transport which reacted favourably
on the Bedawyn who undertook it. Mehemed Ali, also, was
favourably disposed towards the convent. His nephew, Abbas
Pasha, who succeeded him in 1849, visited Sinai in 1853, and
formed the plan of building himself a summer residence on
Mount Horeb. A road was therefore planned leading up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
from Tur on the coast, which crossed the desert and then led
through the relatively luxurious valley of Hebron, with its
many streams and the tamarisk grove of Solaf. It was partly
completed in 1854, when the Pasha was assassinated. His
successor Said Pasha (1854-63), was in friendly relations with
Ferdinand Lesseps, whom he zealously supported in the
scheme for constructing a canal through the Isthmus of Suez.
The enterprise was financed by French and Turkish subscriptions,
and was at the outset worked by means of forced
labour, later with the help of modern engineering appliances.
The canal was completed under Ishmael Pasha (1863-79) in
1869, and the British Government became a large shareholder.
Ishmael Pasha was an Oriental despot who depleted the treasury
and robbed the people, but who modernised Egypt by building
schools, laying down railways, and setting up telegraph communications.
In return for a large annual tribute he was
raised to the rank of Khedive, or viceroy, of Egypt by the
Sultan in 1867. But the financial difficulties, in which he
became involved, were such that France and England brought
pressure to bear on him and finally deposed him. He was
succeeded by his son Tewfik Pasha (1879-92).</p>

<p>Among the visitors to the peninsula in 1845 was Major
Macdonald, who came to inspect the turquoise that was left,
and who settled near the mines at Maghara in 1855, where he
remained ten years. His mining was done with the help
of Bedawyn labour. He took considerable interest in the
great inscriptions, and it was not he, but a French engineer, who
took up the work after he left, who destroyed by blasting a
large number of valuable rock inscriptions, including those of
King Khufu and of the Pharaohs of the Sixth Dynasty. The
general interest taken in the peninsula led to the sending out
an expedition under General Wilson in 1868, who engaged in
a survey of Sinai, <i>i.e.</i> the mountains of the south, under the
auspices of the Palestine Exploration Fund. The work was
published in 1871 and contains text, maps and a number of
photographic views. Among those working on the Survey
was the Rev. F. W. Holland, who had previously stayed in
Sinai in 1861 and 1867; and the distinguished Arabic scholar,
Prof. E. H. Palmer, who made the acquaintance of Sir Richard
Burton on this occasion, and who was brought into prolonged
contact with the Bedawyn. Prof. Palmer published in 1871 a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
special account that deals with the story of the Israelites in
Sinai under the title <i>The Desert of Exodus</i>. Another visitor
to the peninsula was the Egyptologist, Prof. Ebers, who published
his work <i>Durch Gosen zum Sinai</i> in 1872. The interest
in geography now caused travellers to journey along different
routes and to explore different parts of the peninsula, but, in
spite of the work accomplished then or undertaken since, the
central part of the peninsula is still insufficiently known.</p>

<p>From these writers we gain a further insight into the state
of things at the convent, and the attitude of the Bedawyn.</p>

<p>The number of monks at the convent remained much the
same. Seetzen found twenty-five monks there and a “guardian”
who acted for the absentee bishop (i. 73); Edward Robinson
found twenty monks in residence (i. 131); Lepsius in 1845
found twenty-five; Ebers in 1871 found twenty-eight. In
1890 there were between twenty and thirty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>

<p>Of the property that is at present owned by the monks I fail
to find a complete list. At different periods mention is made
of priories in Alexandria, Jerusalem, Tripoli, Gaza, Constantinople,
Crete and Cyprus, besides the house owned at Cairo.<a name="FNanchor_306_306" id="FNanchor_306_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_306_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a>
Wolff, in 1839, mentioned property held by the monks at
Constantinople, Cyprus, Belgrad, Bukarest, Jassy, Athens,
India and Calcutta;<a name="FNanchor_307_307" id="FNanchor_307_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_307_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a> Robinson mentioned houses at Bengal,
Golconda, Crete and Cyprus (p. 549). According to Burckhardt
the monks received their supplies from Gaza and
Cairo.</p>

<p>After an interregnum of eight years Constantius II ruled
as archbishop from 1804 to 1859, and was succeeded by
Cyrillus III (1859-67). The next archbishop, Callistratus (1867-85),
was the first prelate who returned to the convent in 1872,
but his installation was attended by difficulties. His successor,
Porphyrius, fell out with the patriarch of Alexandria, who
caused him to be expelled from Cairo. He was in residence
at the convent in the winter of 1905-6.</p>

<p>Modern accounts give a further insight into the temper
of the men of the desert.</p>

<p>The pilgrims of the Middle Ages generally dreaded the
Bedawyn who were apt to swoop down on them, clamouring
for dues, as they passed from the territory of one tribe into
that of another, but we hear of few excesses committed by
them. Burckhardt, Prof. Palmer and Sir Richard Burton
gave an account of the different tribes.</p>

<p>The Bedawyn of southern Sinai are collectively known as
Towarah from Towa, Arabic for mountain, as distinct from
the Tiyaha, or Bedawyn of the Plain and the tribes who hold
the northern districts.</p>

<p>Among the Towarah Prof. Palmer included (1) the Sawaliheh,
who are divided into three clans or families, of which each has
its sheykh, so that there are three sheykhs to each tribe. In
1870 the sheykhs of the Sawaliheh were Fatir, Kadir Ibn
Simhan and Abu Farh, of whom Fatir was <i>agyd</i> or commander-in-chief
of all the military operations undertaken by the
Towarah generally. Burton spoke of the Salihi (<i>i.e.</i> Sawaliheh
or Benu Saleh) as the principal tribe of the Sinaitic Bedawyn.</p>

<p>The next tribe, included among the Towarah, were (2) the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
Auled Said, who include several families. The sheykhs in
1870 were Hasan Ibn ’Amir and Embarek ed Dheiri.<a name="FNanchor_308_308" id="FNanchor_308_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_308_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a></p>

<p>The next tribe mentioned were (3) the Garrasheh, who are
principally found in the neighbourhood of Wadi Feiran.
Their chief sheykh, Ibn Nasir, was made responsible to the
Egyptian government for the good conduct of the Towarah.
He had died when the expedition returned to England.
Husein Abu Ridhwan was the only remaining sheykh in 1870,
Mansur Ibn Gormah also having recently died.</p>

<p>Another tribe were (4) the Aleyat (or Aliki), whose district
was the neighbourhood of the (western) Wadi Nasb. Their
sheykhs were Suleiman Ibn Emdakkhal, Juma Abu Shawish,
and Amdan Abu Ukri. This tribe was described as not
numerous by Prof. Palmer.</p>

<p>There were further, (5) the Emzeineh, (Muzaineh) the
descendants of an illustrious tribe who are regarded by the
Towarah as comparative strangers, though not excluded from
the right of intermarriage. They roam over the eastern coast
of the peninsula and are said to have come into Sinai from the
Hedjaz in comparatively recent times. According to Sir
Richard Burton five persons, ancestors of the Muzaineh, were
forced by a blood feud to fly from their native country and
landed at Sherm, where they were received by the Aleyat.
With these they jointly own the palm trees at Dahab, and the
rights of transporting the people landing at Dahab and Sherm.
“Anyone who knows the Bedawyn,” wrote Sir Richard, “can
see that the Muzaineh are pure blood. Their brows are broad,
their faces narrow, their features regular, and their eyes of
moderate size, whereas the other Towarah clans are as palpably
Egyptian. They are of an impure race, Egypto-Arabs, whereas
their neighbour, the Hedjazi, is the pure Syrian or Mesopotamian.”</p>

<p>Besides these tribes Prof. Palmer named (6) the Auled
Shahin as the branch of the Towarah, who occupy the country
immediately around Tur and the mountain which borders on
the plain of El Kaa; they are, properly speaking, a branch of
the Aleyat.</p>

<p>There are also, (7) the Gebeliyeh, the so-called serfs of
the convent, who are held to be the lineal descendants of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
four hundred Wallachian and Egyptian slaves whom the
emperor settled in the peninsula. Their district comprises
the Wadi esh Sheikh and the immediate neighbourhood of
the convent. Their chief sheykhs in 1870 were Awwad Ibn
Atiyeh, Eid Ibn Suad and Suleiman Ibn Ghanaim.</p>

<p>Of these tribes the Saidi and the Aleyat are the recognised
<i>ghufara</i>, or protectors of the convent. The MS. account of
1710 calls them Waled Sahin, three tribes, the sons of Saleh,
<i>i.e.</i> the Selim, the Saidi and the Haliq (Aleyat). These met
at the annual festival at the tomb of Nebi Saleh.</p>

<p>The fluctuations of the tribes are insufficiently known.
In Burckhardt’s days Harun Ibn Amer, sheykh of the Saidi,
was accounted one of the most powerful sheykhs of the
Towarah (p. 594).</p>

<p>Of the Towarah generally, Sir R. Burton wrote that in the
reign of Mehemed Ali no governor of Suez dared to flog or
lay hands on a Turi, whatever offence he might have committed
in the town of Suez. Later the wild man’s sword was
taken from him before he was allowed to enter the gates.
In his estimation “the most good-humoured and sociable
of men, they delight in a jest and may readily be managed by
kindness and courtesy. Yet they are passionate, nice on the
point of honour, revengeful and easily offended when their
peculiar prejudices are misunderstood. I have always found
them pleasant companions, and deserving of respect, for their
hearts are good and their courage is beyond a doubt”
(p. 102).</p>

<p>In distinction to the Towarah or men of the mountain,
the Bedawyn further north are known as Tiyaha, or men of
the plain, who go south as far as Nakhl. They have for their
neighbours the Terrebin, a powerful tribe, whose territory
extends from about forty miles south-east of Suez on the
Sinai road as far as Gaza in the north. There are also the
Heiwatt occupying the land between Akaba and Nakhl,
who have a bad reputation for raiding, and their neighbours
the Anazeh, whose pasture grounds extend from about
Medina in Arabia to Palmyra in Syria, including the Arabah.
Another wealthy tribe are the Howeitat who can raise as many
as twelve hundred camels.</p>

<p>The difficulty of dealing with the Bedawyn, was shown by
the events that attended the rising of Arabi in Egypt, in 1880.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
When Tewfik became Khedive in 1879 dissatisfaction reigned.
A military revolution broke out in Cairo, and Arabi Bey, a
fellah officer, arose determined to diminish European influence.
When rioting began at Alexandria the Khedive sought the
protection of the British Fleet, and Sir Garnet Wolseley
occupied the Suez Canal, whereupon Cairo surrendered.
But the dread of Arabi’s influence among the men of the
desert led the British Government to request Prof. Palmer
to bring his influence to bear on the Bedawyn of Et Tîh. His
work in the Ordnance Survey had brought him into friendly
relations with many of the sheykhs, and he was instructed
to prevent them from joining the Egyptian rebels. With
a <i>firmân</i> signed by Tewfik, Prof. Palmer left Jaffa as Abdallah
Effendi, and crossed the peninsula to Suez, being conducted
by Hamdan, the head man of the Tiyaha, and on his way met
the great sheykh of the Heiwatt. His plan was to raise
10,000 of the Tiyaha and Terabin to fight Arabi. From Suez
he therefore departed carrying the sum of £3000 in gold in
order to buy camels, and arranged for a great meeting of the
sheykhs. It was in vain that Sheykh Ode Ismaileh of the
Aleyat, and Umdakhl, a minor sheykh, advised him not to go.
He and his three companions were lured into an ambush in the
Wadi Sudr, and were murdered, August, 1882.<a name="FNanchor_309_309" id="FNanchor_309_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_309_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a></p>

<p>Following upon the mission of Prof. Palmer to Sinai was
the expedition to the Sudan for which General Gordon
volunteered. He was killed in 1885, whereupon General
Kitchener set out to reconquer the Sudan and occupied
Khartoum. In 1892 Tewfik in Egypt was succeeded by
Hussein Kamel. A misunderstanding with Turkey in connection
with the Sinaitic frontier caused a passing difficulty
in the year 1906-7. The Turco-Egyptian frontier was drawn
from Rafa, now in Egypt, to the Gulf of Akaba, Akaba itself
being included in the domain over which Turkey claimed
supremacy. At this it stood at the outbreak of the Great
War.</p>

<p>The population of the whole of the peninsula at the time
was estimated as below 40,000 persons, including the settled
inhabitants of El Arish, the Gebeliyeh (400-500), and the rest
of the Bedawyn. From a military point of view these were
looked upon as of small importance, except as possible secret<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
agents and scouts, and no effort was apparently made to
organise them. Although Sinai was politically an Egyptian
dependency, with the frontier line between Rafa and Akaba,
the Suez Canal was chosen as the means of defending Egypt,
and bridgeheads were constructed along it, chief of which
was the one at Kantara. The peninsula was therefore open
to the Turks, who advanced across it along three routes,
<i>i.e.</i> along the coast, along the pilgrim road from Akaba by way
of Nakhl, and by a route half-way between the pilgrim route
and the Mediterranean. Nakhl became a Turkish military
centre. The attacks made at different points along the canal
were defeated. The Turk, from the first, engaged the help
of the Bedawyn of the eastern desert, but he failed to raise
much enthusiasm among them. Only the Terabin, the
Ayayme, and some of the sub-tribes of the Howeitat supplied
irregular lines, the Ruala and the Anazeh promised to defend
Syria, other tribes failed altogether. When a raiding party
of Turks advanced from Nakhl on Tur, they were joined by
some Bedawyn from Midian and Sinai, who were tempted by
the promise of loot. On the way, they requisitioned food at
the convent, but they found Egyptian troops in occupation
of Tur and were repulsed.</p>

<p>The advance along the shore of the Mediterranean, and
expeditions from the bridgeheads and secured posts, engaged
the Allied forces in 1916. Ayun Musa was fortified and
connected with Suez by means of a light railway, and a
railway was constructed along the Mediterranean. In the
course of this progress the walls and water cisterns on which
the enemy depended were naturally destroyed, and one
does not wonder to find the Bedawyn acting in concert with the
Turk in their defence. It was not till January, 1917, that
Rafa was captured, and the Turk swept out of northern
Sinai. Along the eastern frontier the Arabs were prepared
to side with the Allies. As early as 1916 Prince Hussein of
Mecca organised his forces to resist the Turk, but his progress
was indifferent, when he was sought out by Capt. Lawrence,
who urged him to advance and persuaded Auda Ibn Tayyi,
the great sheykh of the Howeitat, to act in concert with him.
The result was a camel charge on the fort of Akaba, which
wiped out the Turkish battalion stationed there, and freed
the Arab and the Allies from a centre of enemy plotting. By
their action the Arabs made a further step in realising themselves
as a nation.<a name="FNanchor_310_310" id="FNanchor_310_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_310_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a></p>

<p>In the light of these recent events, one is set wondering
how they will affect the chances of well-being of the men of
the Sinai desert, and what future may be in store for the
convent.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
